<p>Sometimes people who are doing hard data work may forget to step back and look at the big picture. This is a common mistake because we can definitely go from scientific data analysis to actionable insight for making better business decision. But we need to have some additional thoughts about whether the decision is a global optima or it’s just local due to the limited sample, restricted project goal, or restricted team scope.</p>

<p><em>When I decided to end my voluntary immersion in the driver community, I could not shake the feeling that the depersonalization of app workers is a feature, not a bug, of an economic model born of and emboldened by transformations that are underway across the global economy. This includes increasingly prevalent work arrangements characterized by weak employer-worker relations (independent contracting), strong reliance on technology (algorithmic management, platform-mediated communication), and social isolation (no coworkers and limited customer interactions).</em></p>
<p><em>As forces continue to erode traditional forms of identity support, meaningful selfdefinition at work will increasingly rely on how we collectively use and misuse innovative technologies and business models.</em><br><em>For example, how can companies deploy algorithmic management in a way that doesn’t threaten and depersonalize workers? How can focusing on the narratives that underlie and animate identities help workers reimagine what they really want and deserve out of a career coming out of the pandemic and the Great Resignation? Will increasingly immersive and realistic digital environments like the metaverse function as identity playgrounds for workers in the future? How will Web3 broadly, and the emergence of novel forms of organizing specifically (e.g., decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs), affect the careers, connections, and causes that are so important to workers? What role can social media platforms, online discussion forums, and other types of virtual water coolers play in helping independent workers craft and sustain a desirable work identity? In short, how can we retain the human element in the face of increasingly shrewd resource management tactics?”</em></p>

<p>This reminds me that last year when I was on vacation in LA, I’ve talked to a driver worked for both Lyft and Uber in LA. He complained Lyft’s route recommendation algorithm is shitty, not helpful at all, a waste of time, while Uber is better in comparison. At that time I realized how important it is to strengthen employer worker relations and gather feedback from workers or clients on the product improvement.<br>This is a great article where the author raises his concerns of dehumanization of workers in the future. While technology is advancing and economy is transforming, we don’t expect people to forget who they are in their daily basis work.</p>

<p><em>Bringing a new technology to market presents a chicken-or-egg problem: The product needs a supply of complementary offerings, but the suppliers and complementors don’t exist yet, and no entrepreneur wants to throw their lot in with a technology that isn’t on the market yet.</em></p>
<p><em>There are two ways of “solving” this problem. First, you can time the market, and wait until the ecosystem matures— though you risk waiting a long time. Second, you can drive the market, or supply all the necessary inputs and complements yourself.</em></p>

<p>Here are two examples. To drive the market, Musk supplies both electric vehicles and charging stations. Zuckerberg proposed the concept of metaverse and changed his company’s name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is where Musk’s Wall Street critics might say he’s weakest. Many of his businesses don’t articulate a clear logic, which is demonstrated by the unpredictable way these businesses ultimately reach solutions or products.</em></p>
<p><em>Musk has spelled out some of his prior logic in a set of “Master Plans,” but most of the logical basis for exactly how he will succeed remains ambiguous. But this isn’t necessarily Musk’s fault or due to any negligence per se: When pursuing new technologies, particularly ones that open up a new market, there is no one who can anticipate the full set of possibilities of what that technology will be able to do (and what it will not be able to do).</em></p>

<p><em>What could he possibly want with Twitter? The thing is, over the last decade, the technological landscape has changed, and how and when to moderate speech has become a critical problem-and an existential problem for social media companies.

<p>This is a great article which profiles Elon Musk specifically in his strategies and vision. It answered my question confusing me for two years: what was Musk thinking on buying Twitter? The answer is: Musk’s vision is not in pursuit of a specific type of solution but is in pursuit of a specific type of problem. If we go back to 2016, Igor as a CEO of Disney decided not to buy Twitter because he looked at Twitter as the solution: a global distribution platform, while concerned the quality of speech on it is a problem. Musk was looking for challenges and complexities while Igor was preventing them and looking for solutions.</p>

<p>I watched Lex’s interview with Sam Altman uploaded on March 18, 2024, and an older interview with Ilya Sutskever happened 3 years ago. Elon’s lawsuit against OpenAI frustrated Sam but Sam is optimistic about the future and everything he is going to release in the next few months. Sam answered the questions “what does open mean in OpenAI” that ‘open’ mainly means putting powerful tech in the hands of people for free as a public good, but not necessarily mean open-source. He said there can be open-source models or closed-source models. About the transition between non-profit to capped for-profit, Sam said OpenAI is not setting a precedent for startup to mimic it but he suggested most startups should go for for-profit directly if they pursue profitability in the beginning.</p>
<p>Ilya’s interview is more interesting to me because he talked a lot about vision, tech, philosophy in Deep Learning. It’s impressive that he had such thoughts 3 years ago. </p>

<p><em>Speech is one kind of liability for companies using generative AI.

</blockquote>
<p>The Section 230 of Communications Decency Act of 1996 has protected internet platforms from being held liable for the things we say on them, but it doesn’t cover speech that a company’s  AI generates. It’s likely that in the future companies use AI will be liable for whatever it does. It could be a driver of pushing companies to take effort to avoid problematic AI output, and reduce “hallucinations” (when GenAI makes stuff up). </p>
<p>A very obvious downside is people could use AI to do harmful things, but I think people are good to work together and prevent that from different angles such as legal aspect or open source software. I worry more about things that are potential or cannot be seen at least in these years when AI is still immature - which is being too early to rely on AI and deviating from truth. For example, it is too soon for people to lose faith in jobs like teachers, historians, journalists, writers, etc, but I’m concerning people are already losing faith in those jobs because of the development of AI and some violations of copyrighted work. As we have seen that AI could have wrong understanding of facts, have biased opinions, and make things up that don’t exist, we lives could fight for the truth but the dead cannot talk. </p>

<p><em>Nvidia is counting on companies to buy large quantities of these GPUs, of course, and is packaging them in larger designs, like the GB200 NVL72, which plugs 36 CPUs and 72 GPUs into a single liquid-cooled rack for a total of 720 petaflops of AI training performance or 1,440 petaflops (aka 1.4 exaflops) of inference. It has nearly two miles of cables inside, with 5,000 individual cables.</em></p>
<p><em>And of course, Nvidia is happy to offer companies the rest of the solution, too. Here’s the DGX Superpod for DGX GB200, which combines eight systems in one for a total of 288 CPUs, 576 GPUs, 240TB of memory, and 11.5 exaflops of FP4 computing.</em></p>
<p><em>Nvidia says its systems can scale to tens of thousands of the GB200 superchips, connected together with 800Gbps networking with its new Quantum-X800 InfiniBand (for up to 144 connections) or Spectrum-X800 ethernet (for up to 64 connections).</em></p>

<p>Two B200 GPUs combined with one Grace CPU is a GB200 Blackwell Superchip. Two GB200 superchip is one Blackwell compute node. 18 Blackwell compute notes contain 36 CPU + 72 GPUs, becoming one larger virtual GPU - GB200 NVL72.</p>
<p>Nvidia also offers packages for companies such as DGX Superpod for DGX GB200 which combines 8 such GB200 NVL72. 8 GB200 NVL72 combined with xx becomes one GB200 NVL72 compute rack. And the AI factory or full data center in the future would consists about 56 GB200 NVL72 compute racks, which is in total around 32000 GPUs.</p>
<p>The Blackwell superchip will be 4 times faster and 25 times energy efficient than H100.</p>

<p>On March 14 (local time), during a meeting with the Korean Silicon Valley correspondent group, CEO Altman mentioned, “I am not sure when GPT-5 will be released, but it will make significant progress as a model taking a leap forward in advanced reasoning capabilities. There are many questions about whether there are any limits to GPT, but I can confidently say ‘no’.” He expressed confidence that if sufficient computing resources are invested, building AGI that surpasses human capabilities is entirely feasible.</p>

<p>Google DeepMind SIMA Team is working on the Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project. The goal is to develop an agent that follows instructions to complete tasks in any 3D environments. So far they are making progress on making AI agent understand the environment from computer screen, and use keyboard-and-mouse controls to interact with environment, follow language instructions, and play the video game to maximize the win-rate.</p>
<p>OpenAI has similar work called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openai.com/research/universe">OpenAI Universe</a>, which aims to train and validate AI agent on performing real world tasks. They started from video game environment as well. Although the goals of these two project sound similar, the minor difference is that OpenAI Universe intended to develop a platform where AI is able to interact with games, websites, and applications, while SIMA aims to develop an AI agent or maybe a robot to interact with the real world.</p>

Lehigh University and Microsoft Research developed Mora to address the gap of no other video generation models to parallel with Sora in performance. Mora introduces an innovative multi-agent framework. As a result, Mora marks a considerable advancement in video generation from text prompts. The evaluation shows that Mora competes with Sora on most of the tasks, but not as refined as Sora in tasks such as changes in the video content, and video connectivity. </p>

<p><em>We know from our past experiences that big things start small. The biggest oak starts from an acorn.

<p><em>He was a free thinker whose ideas would often run against the conventional wisdom of any community in which he operated.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve always actually found something to be very true, which is most people don’t get those experiences because they never ask. I have never found anybody who didn’t want to help me when I’ve asked them for help. I have never found anyone who said no or hung up the phone when I called. I just asked. And when people ask me, I try to be as responsive, to pay back that debt of gratitude. Most people never pick up the phone and call. Most people never ask. That is what separates the people that do things from the people that just dream about them. You’ve got to act and you’ve got to be willing to fail. You’ve got to be ready to crash and burn with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. If you’re afraid of failing, you won’t get very far.</em></p>

He links this machine made a few months earlier, a few months ago by some disheveled California misfits to Rolls Royce, the 73 year old paragon of sophisticated industrial manufacturing and elite consumer taste. He even calls Apple a world leader, an absolutely unprovable claim that rockets the little company into the same league as IBM, which was then the industry’s giant. He was an extraordinary speaker and he wielded that tool to great effect.</em></p>
<p><em>People that are learning machines and they refuse to quit are incredibly hard to beat.</em></p>
<p><em>When you have something that’s working, you do not talk about it. You shut up because the more you talk about it, the more broadcasting you do about it, the more it encourages competition.</em></p>
<p><em>The only purpose for me in building a company is so that the company can make products. One is a means to the other. Over a period of time, you realize that building a very strong company and a very strong foundation of talent and culture in a company is essential to keep making great products. The company’s one of the most amazing inventions of humans, this abstract construct that’s incredibly powerful. Even so, for me, it’s about the products. It’s about working together with really fun, smart, creative people and making wonderful things. It is not about the money. What a company is, then, is a group of people who can make more than just the next big thing. It is a talent. It is a capability. It is a culture. It is a point of view. And it is a way of working together to make the next thing and the next one and the next one.</em></p>
<p><em>In that case, Steve would check it out, and the information he’d glean would go into the learning machine that was his brain. Sometimes, that’s where it would sit and nothing would happen. Sometimes, on the other hand, he’d concoct a way to combine it with something else that he’d seen or perhaps to twist it in a way to benefit an entirely different project altogether. This was one of his great talents, the ability to synthesize separate developments and technologies into something previously unimaginable.</em></p>
<p><em>I felt I had let the previous generations of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce, and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure and even thought about running away from the Valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me. I still love what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love, and so I decided to start over.</em></p>

<p><em>It helps if you can be satisfied with an inner scorecard, I would also say it’s probably the only – the single only way to have a happy life.</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted money. It could make me independent then I could do with what I wanted to do with my life. And the biggest thing I wanted to do was work for myself. I didn’t want other people directing me. The idea of doing what I wanted to do every day was very important to me.</em></p>
<p><em>I like to work by myself where I could spend my time thinking about things I wanted to think about. Washington was upsetting at first, but I was in my own world all the time. I could be sitting in a room thinking or could be writing around flinging things and thinking.</em></p>
<p><em>Walt Disney seldom dabbled. Everyone who knew him remarked on his intensity. When something intrigued him, he focused himself entirely on it as if it were the only thing that mattered.</em></p>
<p><em>Intensity is the price of excellence.</em></p>
<p><em>People ask me where they should go to work, and I always tell them to go work for whom they most admire.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s like saving sex for your old age, do what you love and work for whom you admire the most, and you’ve given yourself the best chance in life you can.</em></p>
<p><em>You’ll get very rich if you thought of yourself as having a card with only 20 punches in a lifetime, and every financial decision used up one punch. You will resist the temptation to dabble. You make more good decisions, and you would make more big decisions.</em></p>
<p><em>Instead, he said, basically, when you get to my age, you’ll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. I know people who have a lot of money, and they get testimonial dinners and they get hospital wings named after them. But the truth is that nobody in the world loves them. If you get to my age and life and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big your bank account is.</em></p>
<p><em>Your life is a disaster. That’s the ultimate test of how you’ve lived your life. The trouble with love is you can’t buy it. You can buy sex. You can buy testimonial dinners. You can buy pamphlets that say how wonderful you are, but the only way to get love is to be lovable. It is very irritating if you have a lot of money. You’d like to think you could write a check. I’ll buy $1 million worth of love, please, but it doesn’t work that way.</em></p>

<p><em>Amazon’s single-threaded leadership: “The basic premise is that for each project, there is a single leader whose focus is that project and that project alone. And that leader oversees teams of people whose attention is similarly focused on that one project.”</em></p>
<p><em>Similar idea in Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One: “The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. Every employee’s one thing was unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing. I had started doing this just to simplify the task of managing people, but then I noticed a deeper result. Defining roles reduced conflict.”</em></p>
<p><em>“When your dependencies keep growing, it’s only natural to try speeding things up by improving your communication. We finally realize that all of this cross-team communication didn’t really need refinement at all. It needed to be eliminated. It wasn’t just that we had the wrong solution in mind. Rather, we’ve been trying to solve the wrong problem altogether.”</em></p>
<p><em>Jeff’s vision was that we needed to focus on loosely coupled interaction via machines through well-defined APIs rather than via humans through e-mails and meetings. This would free each team to act autonomously and move faster.</em></p>
<p><em>From his 2016 shareholder letter, Jeff suggested that most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong, may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.</em></p>
<p><em>“The best way to fail and inventing something is by making it somebody’s part-time job. And so the problem that they were trying to solve and the vision they had was how to move faster and remove dependencies, but what they also realized once this was in place, that ownership and accountability are much easier to establish under the single-threaded leader model.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there.” “Long-term thinking levers are existing abilities and lets us do new things we couldn’t otherwise contemplate. Long-term orientation interacts well with customer obsession. If we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that the need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution.”</em></p>
<p><em>Invention works well where differentiation matters. Differentiation with customers is often one of the key reasons to invent.</em></p>
<p><em>Working backwards exposes skill sets that your company needs but does not have yet. So the longer that your company works backwards, the more skills it develops and the more skills it develops, the more valuable it becomes over time.</em></p>
<p><em>Founders force the issue. Not outsourcing means it’s going to be more expensive, going to spend a lot of or money. It’s going to take longer to get a product out there. But at the end of that, if we are successful, we have a set of skills that we lacked beforehand, then we can go out and do this over and over again.</em></p>

<p><em>“My passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products. Everything else was secondary. Sure, it was great to make a profit because that’s what allowed you to make great products. But the products, not the profits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to make money.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s a subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything, the people you hire, who gets promoted, what you discuss in meetings. Some people say, give the customer what they want, but that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, ‘If I asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, a faster horse.’ People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page. Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science. I like that intersection. There’s something magical about that place.”</em></p>
<p> <em>“There are a lot of people innovating, and that’s not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple resonates with people is that there’s a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think great artists and great engineers are similar in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact, some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicians on the side.”</em> </p>
<p><em>“In the ‘70s, computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great at science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor. At different times in the past, there were companies that exemplified Silicon Valley. It was Hewlett-Packard for a long time. Then in the semiconductor era, it was Fairchild and Intel. I think that it was Apple for a while, and then that faded. And then today, I think it’s Apple and Google and a little more so Apple. I think Apple has stood the test of time. It’s been around for a while, but it’s still at the cutting edge of what’s going on.”</em> </p>
<p><em>“It’s easy to throw stones at Microsoft, and yet I appreciate what they did and how hard it was. They were very good at the business side of things. They were never as ambitious product-wise as they should have been. Bill likes to portray himself as a man of the product, but he’s really not. He’s a businessperson. Winning business was more important than making great products. He ended up the wealthiest guy around. And if that was his goal, then he achieved it. But it’s never been my goal. And I wonder in the end if it was his goal.”</em> </p>
<p><em>“I admire him for the company he built. It’s impressive, and I enjoyed working with him. He’s bright and actually has a good sense of humor. But Microsoft never had the humanities and liberal arts in its DNA. Even when they saw the Mac, they couldn’t copy it well. They totally didn’t get it. I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field. And then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing great salesmen because they’re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So the salespeople end up running the company. When the sales guys run the company, the product guys don’t matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It happened at Apple when Sculley came in, which was my fault. Apple was lucky, and it rebounded. I hate it when people call themselves entrepreneurs when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public so they can cash in and move on. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business. That is how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You build a company that will stand for something a generation or two from now. That’s what Walt Disney did and Hewlett and Packard and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That’s what I want Apple to be. I don’t think I run roughshod over people. But if something sucks, I tell people to their face. It is my job to be honest. I know what I’m talking about, and I usually turn out to be right. That’s the culture I try to create. We are brutally honest with each other, and anyone can tell me they think I’m full of s***, and I can tell them the same.”</em></p>
<p><em>“And we’ve had some rip-roaring arguments where we were yelling at each other and it’s some of the best times I’ve ever had. I feel totally comfortable saying, ‘Ron, that story looks like s,’ in front of everyone else. Or I might say, ‘God, we really fed up the engineering on this,’ in front of the person that’s responsible. That’s the ante for being in the room. You’ve got to be able to be super honest. Maybe there’s a better way, a gentlemen’s club, where we all wear ties and speak in soft language and velvet code words. But I don’t know that way because I’m middle class from California.”</em> </p>
<p><em>“I was hard on people sometimes, probably harder than I needed to be. I remember the time when my son was six years old, coming home, I had just fired somebody that day. And I imagined what it was like for that person to tell his family and his young son that he had lost his job. It was hard, but somebody has got to do it. I figured that it was always my job to make sure that the team was excellent. And if I didn’t do it, nobody was going to do it. You always have to keep pushing to innovate.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Bob Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn’t. He had to move on. And when he did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966 Europe tour was his greatest. He would come on and do a set of acoustic guitars and the audience loved him. Then he would do an electric set and the audience booed. There was one point where he was about to sing Like a Rolling Stone and someone from the audience yells, “Judas,” and Dylan says, ‘Play it f***ing loud,’ and they did. The Beatles were the same way. They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That is what I’ve always tried to do. Keep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, ‘If you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying.’”</em></p>
<p><em>“What drove me? I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that’s been done by others before us. I didn’t invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to that flow. It’s about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That is what has driven me.”</em></p>
<p><em>“He was not a model boss or human being, tightly packaged for emulation. Driven by demons, he would drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and passions and products were all interrelated. His tale is thus both instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t focus too much on being pragmatic. Logical thinking has its place but really go on intuition and emotion. I began to realize that an intuitive understanding and consciousness was far more significant than abstract thinking and intellectual logical analysis.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Whatever he was interested in, he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.”</em></p>
<p><em>Charlie Munger says, “In business, we often find that the winning system goes almost ridiculously far in maximizing or minimizing one or a few variables.”</em></p>
<p><em>“He made me do something I didn’t think I could do. It was the brighter side of what would become known as his reality distortion field. If you trust him, you can do things,” Holmes said. “If he decided that something should happen, then he’s just going to make it happen.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him, pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Jobs had a bravado that helped him get things done, occasionally by manipulating people. He could be charismatic, even mesmerizing, but also cold and brutal. Jobs was awed by Wozniak’s engineering wizardry and Wozniak was awed by Jobs’ business strive. I never wanted to deal with people and step on toes. But Steve could call up people he didn’t know and make them do things.”</em></p>
<p><em>“In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all the unimportant opportunities.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want and you go forward with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think.”</em></p>
<p><em>The reality distortion field was a confounding combination of a charismatic rhetorical style, indomitable will and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.</em></p>
<p><em>“Jobs is a strong world elitist artist, who doesn’t want his creations mutated inauspiciously by unworthy programmers. It would be as if someone off the street added some brush strokes to a Picasso painting or changed the lyrics to a Bob Dylan song.”</em></p>
<p><em>“If you want to live your life in a creative way, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away. The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times artists have to say, ‘Bye, I have to go. I’m going crazy, and I’m getting out of here.’ And then they go hybrid somewhere. Maybe later, they reemerge a little differently.”</em></p>

<p><em>The qubit in superposition has some probability of being 1 or 0, but it represents neither state, just like our quarter flipping into the air is neither heads nor tails, but some probability of both. A quantum computer can use a collection of qubits in superpositions to play with different possible paths through a calculation. If done correctly, the pointers to incorrect paths cancel out, leaving the correct answer when the qubits are read out as Os and 1s.</em></p>
<p><em>Grover’s algorithm, a famous quantum search algorithm, could find you in a phone book of 100 million names with just 10,000 operations. If a classical search algorithm just spooled through all the listings to find you, it would require 50 million operations, on average.</em></p>
<p><em>Qubits have to be carefully shielded, and operated at very cold temperatures-sometimes only fractions of a degree above absolute zero. A major area of research involves developing algorithms for a quantum computer to correct its own errors, caused by glitching qubits.</em></p>
<p><em>Some researchers, most notably at Microsoft, hope to sidestep this challenge by developing a type of qubit out of clusters of electrons known as a topological qubit. Physicists predict topological qubits to be more robust to environmental noise and thus less error-prone, but so far they’ve struggled to make even one.</em></p>
<p><em>Teams in both the public and private sector are betting so, as Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft have all expanded their teams working on the technology, with a growing swarm of startups such as Xanadu and QuEra in hot pursuit. The US, China, and the European Union each have new programs measured in the billions of dollars to stimulate quantum R&amp;D. Some startups, such as Rigetti and lonQ, have even begun trading publicly on the stock market by merging with a so-called special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC-a trick to quickly gain access to cash.</em></p>
<p><em>Chemistry simulations may be the first practical use for these prototype machines, as researchers are figuring out how to make their qubits interact like electrons in a molecule. Daimler and Volkswagen have both started investigating quantum computing as a way to improve battery chemistry for electric vehicles. Microsoft says other uses could include designing new catalysts to make industrial processes less energy intensive, or even pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change. Tech companies like Google are also betting that quantum computers can make artificial intelligence more powerful.</em></p>
<p><em>Big Tech companies argue that programmers need to get ready now. Google, IBM, and Microsoft have all released open source tools to help coders familiarize themselves with writing programs for quantum hardware. IBM offers online access to some of its quantum processors, so anyone can experiment with them. Launched in 2019, Amazon Web Services offers a service that connects users to startup-built quantum computers made of various qubit types over the cloud. In 2020, the US government launched an initiative to develop a K-12 curriculum relating to quantum computing. That same year, the University of New South Wales in Australia offered the world’s first bachelor’s degree in quantum engineering.</em></p>

<p>This article is pretty comprehensive in describing quantum computing mechanism and techniques. One interesting fact is that quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into bank accounts and breaking encryption and cryptography. Shor’s algorithm has been proven mathematically that if you had a large enough quantum computer, you could find the prime factor of large numbers - the basis of RSA encryption, the most commonly used thing on the internet. Although we are far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute Shor’s algorithm on that scale, cryptography research has already been preparing for quantum computers’ code-breaking capabilities.</p>

<p>Meta is taking the lead of open-source LLM by releasing the AI language model LLaMA. Some say open source is necessary to ensure AI safety and faster LLM progress. Others argue that there will be more personalized spam and phishing due to the fact of the model has already leaked on 4chan, and a wave of malicious use of AI. There are pros and cons of open sourcing LLM, just like last year OpenAI open sourced Stable Diffusion which has a lot of bad potential influences. But while every is making AI models private, there has to be someone who makes it public, then everyone goes public. The good and necessary thing is that open source software can help decentralize AI power.</p>

<p><em>“Sora has a deep understanding of language, enabling it to accurately interpret prompts and generate compelling characters that express vibrant emotions,” OpenAI writes in a blog post. “The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt, but also how those things exist in the physical world.”</em></p>
<p><em>“[Sora] may struggle with accurately simulating the physics of a complex scene, and may not understand specific instances of cause and effect. For example, a person might take a bite out of a cookie, but afterward, the cookie may not have a bite mark. The model may also confuse spatial details of a prompt, for example, mixing up left and right, and may struggle with precise descriptions of events that take place over time, like following a specific camera trajectory.”</em></p>

It’s capable of managing up  to 1M tokens - equivalent to 700000 words, one hour of video, or 11 hours of audio. What’s exciting is that it leverages a transformer-based architecture with a specifically designed long context window, which allows it to remember and process vast amounts of information. It’s able to achieve tasks like summarizing lectures from lengthy videos. It’s really able to retrieve ‘needles’ from a ‘haystack’ of millions of tokens across different structures of data sources with accuracy of 99%.</p>

<p>Apple Vision Pro launched on Feb 2, 2024 at $3,499. It’s interesting that Meta and Apple are starting on opposite ends of the spectrum. Meta quest has the right price and will try to improve the technology overtime. Apple Vision Pro has the right technology and will try to lower the price overtime. With a price of 3499, Apple is targeting the high end of the market, not aiming for a mass market product in the first iteration. Instead their sights are set on the early adaptors. It’s a pattern that most Apple products take several years to achieve the mass production. The first iteration of iPhone in 2007 was a soft launch. iPhone didn’t crack 10M units per quarter until the iPhone 4 in late 2010. Now Apple sells about 200M iPhones every year. So it’s highly possible that mass adoption of technologically improved mixed-reality headsets with more affordable pricing is coming in a decade.</p>

<p><em>Extreme success is likely to be caused by some combination of the following factors. Number one, extreme maximization or minimization of one or two variables. Number two, adding success factors so that a bigger combination drives success, often in a nonlinear fashion. Number three, an extreme of good performance over many factors.

<p><em>Apple is about people who think outside the box, people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference and not just get a job done.</em></p>
<p><em>As technology becomes more and more complex, Apple’s core strength of knowing how to make very sophisticated technology, comprehensible to mere mortals is in even greater demand.</em></p>
<p><em>Be a yardstick of quality. Some people are not used to an environment where excellence is expected.</em></p>
<p><em>Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it’s really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn’t what it looked like, although, that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it’s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really, thoroughly understand something, to chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.</em></p>

<p><em>I always considered a part of my job was to keep the quality level of people in the organizations I work with very high. That’s what I consider one of the few things that actually can contribute individually to, to really try to instill in the organization the goal of only having A players.</em></p>
<p><em>The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.</em></p>

<p><em>And Steve said, “Yes. That’s exactly the way I saw the Macintosh. If I ask someone who had only use a personal calculator, what a Macintosh should be, they couldn’t have told me. There was no way to do consumer research on it. I had to go and create it and then show it to the people and say, now what do you think?”</em></p>
<p><em>Both of them had this ability to, well, not invent products, but discover products. Both of” – this is wild, man. “Both of them said these products had always existed. It’s just that no one has ever seen them before. We were the ones who discovered them. The polaroid camera had always existed, and the Macintosh had always existed. It was a matter of discovery. Steve had huge admiration for Dr. Land. He was fascinated by him.</em></p>
<p><em>“Jobs had said several times that he thinks technological creativity and artistic creativity are two sides of the same coin. When asked about the differences between art and technology, he said, ‘I’ve never believed that they’re separate.’ Leonard da Vinci was a great artist and a great scientist. Michelangelo knew a tremendous amount about how to cut stones at a quarry, not just how to make a sculpture, right?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t believe that the best people in any of these fields see themselves as one branch of a forked tree. I just don’t see that. People bring these ideas together a lot. Dr. Land at Polaroid said, ‘I want Polaroid to stand at the intersection of art and science, and I’ve never forgotten that.’”</em></p>
<p><em>In 30 years since founding Apple, Jobs has remained remarkably consistent. The demand for excellence, the pursuit of great design, the instinct for marketing, the insistence on each – on ease of use and compatibility, all have been there from the get-go.</em></p>
<p><em>“The things that Jobs cares about, design, ease of use, good advertising, are right in the sweet spot of the new computer industry. Apple is the only company left in this industry that designs the whole thing,” Jobs said.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hardware, software, developer relations, marketing. It turns out that, in my opinion, that is Apple’s greatest strategieec advantage. It is Apple’s core strategic advantage. If you believe that there’s still room for innovation in this industry, which I do, because Apple can then innovate faster than anyone else. The great thing is that Apple’s DNA hasn’t changed,” Jobs said. “The place where Apple has been standing for the last two decades is exactly where computer technology and the consumer electronics markets are converging. So it’s not like we’re having to cross the river to go somewhere else. The other side of the river is coming to us.”</em></p>

<p><em>A topological qubit is a system that encodes data into the properties of pairs of non-Abelian anyons by physically swapping them around with each other in space.

<p>Researcher from Google and Quantinuum demonstrated a mechanism needed for a component called a topological qubit, which should promise a means to maintain and manipulate information encoded into quantum states more robustly than existing hardware designs. Topological qubits store and work with digital information in non-Abelian anyons, which retain a sort of “memory” of their past movement that enables the representation of binary data. While physicists previous proved the existence of non-Abelian anyons, Quantinuum’s and Google’s work are the first to demonstrate their signature feature, memory of movement. However, people disagreed that topological qubit has been created because the object was too fragile for practical use and cannot reliably manipulate information to achieve practical quantum computing. Delivering a practical topological qubit will require all kinds of studies of non-Abelian anyons and the math underpinning their quirky behavior. Technological breakthrough can be expected after incremental progress.</p>

<p><em>Optimizing LLMs to run on battery-powered devices has been a growing focus for AI researchers. Academic papers are not a direct indicator of how Apple intends to add new features to its products, but they offer a rare glimpse into its secretive research labs and the company’s latest technical breakthroughs.</em></p>
<p><em>“Our work not only provides a solution to a current computational bottleneck but also sets a precedent for future research,” wrote Apple’s researchers in the conclusion to their paper. “We believe as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, approaches like this work will be essential for harnessing their full potential in a wide range of devices and applications.”</em></p>

<p>Apple is developing solutions to running LLM or other AI models directly on a customer’s iPhone. The published paper is titled “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11514.pdf">LLM in a Flash</a>“. Apple’s focus is different from Microsoft’s and Google’s focus of developing Chatbots and GenAI over the Internet from cloud computing platform. I think the smartphone market would be revived and customer experience would be largely changed in the future with this potential vision of personalized and mobile AI agents &#x2F; assistants. If this personalized little AI agent can learn everything about a person from childhood to adult, can we eventually get a perfect adult mind? It reminds me of what Alan Turing said about AI: </p>
<p><em>“Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.”</em></p>

<p>This article (Quick Essay: A Short History of OpenAI) reviewed the history of OpenAl from 2015 when it’s founded to 2023 when Sam was once fired. A crucial development happened in 2018 when the company first introduced the foundational architecture of GPT in a paper “Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training”. This leads to the flagship product of the company - ChatGPT, in Nov 2022. In 2019 OpenAl transited from nonprofit to a “capped-profit” model. This novel convoluted corporate structure led to conflicting motivations and incentives within the company and it latter raised board’s concern about company’s commitment to safety.</p>
<p>Sam Altman was fired on Nov 17, 2023. On Nov 19, 2023, OpenAl hired former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as its interim CEO. Meanwhile Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that they would hired Sam to lead a new Al department. On Nov 20, 2023, Nearly all 800 OpenAl employees signed a letter calling for the resignation of the company’s board and the return of Altman as CEO. On Nov 21, 2023, Sam returned as CEO of OpenAl.</p>
<p>One story in 2020: Two of the lead Al developers Amodei and his sister Daniela left OpenAl in late 2020 to launch Anthropic over concerns the company was moving too quickly to commercialize its technology. Anthropic was founded aiming to develop more safer and trustworthy model and it has billions invested from Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Zoom, etc.</p>
<p>Since Sam was rehired, the questions about neglecting Al safety has been quieted, and new board members appear to be more focused on profitability. There is no doubt of OpenAl’s capability of profitably scaling ChatGPT, but it should raise doubts about whether OpenAl is still committing to its purpose in the future. </p>
<p>Sutskever was recruited to OpenAl from Google in 2015 by Elon Musk, who describes him as “the linchpin for OpenAl being successful”. A tweet from Greg Brockman confirms that Ilya was a key figure in Altman’s removal. But Sutskever also a signee calling Sam back to CEO. He later said he deeply regret his participation in the board’s actions.</p>

<p><em>The Netherlands has restricted the export of ASML’s cutting-edge extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines to China, a decision influenced by international diplomatic pressures, notably from the US.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>ASML is the sole producer of advanced EUV lithorgraphy machines at the center of global chip supply chain. Since the restriction of export of EUV lithography machines to China, it is now also at the mercy of the US-China trade war. There is a list of risk ASML is facing: IP theft and security breaches, cybersecurity costs, China’s ambitions of developing its semiconductor sector, semiconductor industry volatility (shortage and gluts), etc. </p>

          <p>Hello World, </p>
<p>This is Di, living in my 25th year of life. I’m INTJ.</p>
<p>It’s been half a year since I graduated from school and started my career. School life and work life are drastically different but both of them are fascinating. I have changed a lot after school in many things such as habit and mindset. But one habit never changes is daily reading and learning. (Here are some of my pre-25-year-old notes: <a href="https://jokerdii.github.io/">https://jokerdii.github.io/</a>) </p>
<p>I still remember at the time when ChatGPT released I was taking “Quantitative Methods in NLP” course at MIT. Then I observed AI waves got stronger in 2023. Technology changed rapidly throughout the year with one great paper followed by another. And human’s life started to change rapidly as well. I don’t know whether it is because a lot of things going on outside, my mind is excited and spinning with full of information every single day. </p>
<p>I never had a habit of taking diary in my life. I didn’t film my life and I use social media only for chatting and “friend making”. But I finally decided to start it specifically for documenting what I read and learned in my spare time. And it is for me internal use only because 1) I’d like to write something as an output to make sure my brain exactly gets the input, and 2) I’d like to document great things because my brain has a very limited memory.</p>
