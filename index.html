<p><em>As Columbia Business School professor Rita McGrath points out, it’s about identifying “the strategic inflection points” at which the cost of waiting exceeds to cost acting — in other words, identifying the most strategic point to enter a market or adopt a technology, balancing the risks and opportunities based on market readiness, technological maturity and organizational capacity.</em></p>
<p><em>This speaks to the growing adoption of agile, “act, learn, build” approaches over traditional “prove-plan-execute” orientations. The popularity of techniques like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/1995/07/discovery-driven-planning">discovery-driven planning</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">the lean startup</a>, and other agile approaches and propagated this philosophy in which, rather than building bullet-proof business cases, one makes small steps, learning from them, and deciding whether to invest further.</em></p>
<p><strong>―  “6 Strategic Concepts That Set High-Performing Companies Apart”, Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2024/03/6-strategic-concepts-that-set-high-performing-companies-apart">Article</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a very good read. It provided real world business examples such as Nvidia’s partnership with ARM Holdings and Amazon’s Alexa offering for the strategic concept “borrow someone’s road”, Microsoft’s decision to make Office available on Apple’s iOS devices in 2014 and Microsoft’s partnership with Adobe, Salesforce, and Google for the strategic concept “Parter with a third party”, Deere &amp; Co’s decision on openly investing in precision agriculture technologies for the strategic concept “reveal your strategy”, Mastercard’s “Beyond Cash” initiative in 2012 for the strategic concept “be good”, Ferrari’s strategic entry into the luxury SUV market for the strategic concept “let the competition go”, and Tesla’s modular approach to battery manufacturing for the strategic concept “adopt small scale attacks”. </p>

<p><em>Gig work is structured in a way that strengthens the alignment between customers and companies and deepens the divide between customers and workers, leading to systemic imbalances in its service triangle.</em> </p>
<p><em>Bridging the customer-worker divide can result in higher customer trust and platform commitment, both by the customer and the worker.</em> </p>
<p><em>To start, platforms need to increase transparency, reduce information asymmetry, and price their services clearly, allowing customers to better understand what they are paying for rather than only seeing an aggregated total at the end of the transaction. This, in turn, can help customers get used to the idea that if workers are to be paid fairly, gig work cannot be a free or low-cost service.</em></p>
<p><em>Gig workers might be working through an app, but they are not robots, and they deserve to be treated respectfully and thoughtfully. So tip well, rate appropriately, and work together to make the experience as smooth as possible both for yourself and for workers.</em></p>
<p><strong>―  “How Gig Work Pits Customers Against Workers”, Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2024/04/how-gig-work-pits-customers-against-workers">Article</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good article for better understanding how gig work structured differently than other business model, and what the key points are for better business performance and triangle relationships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>TCP&#x2F;IP unlocked new economic value by dramatically lowering the cost of connections. Similarly, blockchain could dramatically reduce the cost of transactions. It has the potential to become the system of record for all transactions. If that happens, the economy will once again undergo a radical shift, as new, blockchain-based sources of influence and control emerge.</em></p>
<p><em>“Smart contracts” may be the most transformative blockchain application at the moment. These automate payments and the transfer of currency or other assets as negotiated conditions are met. For example, a smart contract might send a payment to a supplier as soon as a shipment is delivered. A firm could signal via blockchain that a particular good has been receivedor the product could have GPS functionality, which would automatically log a location update that, in turn, triggered a payment. We’ve already seen a few early experiments with such self-executing contracts in the areas of venture funding, banking, and digital rights management.</em></p>
<p><em>The implications are fascinating. Firms are built on contracts, from incorporation to buyer-supplier relationships to employee relations. If contracts are automated, then what will happen to traditional firm structures, processes, and intermediaries like lawyers and accountants? And what about managers? Their roles would all radically change. Before we get too excited here, though, let’s remember that we are decades away from the widespread adoption of smart contracts. They cannot be effective, for instance, without institutional buy-in. A tremendous degree of coordination and clarity on how smart contracts are designed, verified, implemented, and enforced will be required. We believe the institutions responsible for those daunting tasks will take a long time to evolve, And the technology challenges especially security are daunting.</em></p>
<p><strong>―  “The Truth About Blockchain”, Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain">Article</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the second Blockchain related article I have read from Harvard Business Review. Different authors have different perspectives. Unlike the previous article with a lot of concerns and cautions about Web3, this article seems more optimistic. It proposed a framework for adopting blockchain to revolutionize modern business, and a guidance to Blockchain investment. It points out that Blockchain has great potentials in boosting the efficiency and reducing the cost for all transactions and then explained the reason why the adoption of Blockchain would be slow by making a comparison with TCP&#x2F;IP, which took more than 30 years to reshape the economy by dramatically lowering the cost of connections. This is an interesting comparison: e-mail enabled bilateral messaging as the first application of TCP&#x2F;IP, while bitcoin enables bilateral financial transactions as the first application of Blockchain. It reminds me about what people (Jun Lei, Huateng Ma, Lei Ding, etc) were thinking about internet mindset and business model back in 2000s.</p>
<p>In the end, the authors proposed a four-quadrant framework for adopting Blockchain step by step. The four quadrants are created by two dimensions: novelty (equivalent to the amount of efforts required to ensure users understand the problem) and complexity (equivalent to the amount of coordination and collaboration required to produce values). With the increase of both dimensions, the adoption will require more institutional change. An example of “low novelty and low complexity” is simply adding bitcoin as an alternative transaction method. An example of “low novelty and high complexity” is building a new, fully formed cryptocurrency system which requires wide adoption from every monetary transaction party and consumers’ complete understanding of cryptocurrency. An example of “high novelty and low complexity” is building a local private network on which multiple organizations are connected via a distributed ledger. An example of “high novelty and high complexity” is building “smart contracts”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s been reported that there are over 1000 Indian workers behind the cameras of Just Walk Out. It sounds dystopian and reminds me of “Snowpiercer” movie in 2013. In 2022, about 700 of every 1000 Just Walk Out sales had to be reviewed by Amazon’s team in India, according to The Information. Amazon spokesperson explained that the technology is made by AI (computer vision and deep learning) while it does rely on human moderators and data labelers. Amazon clarified that it’s not true that Just Walk Out relies on human reviewers. They said object detection and receipt generation are completely AI powered, so no human watching live videos. But human are responsible for labeling and annotation for data preparation, which also requires watching videos.</p>
<p>I guess the technology was not able to complete the task end-to-end by itself without supervision or it’s still on the developing stage? I believe it could be Amazon’s strategy to build and test Just Walk Out, Amazon Dash Cart, and Amazon One at the same time while improving AI system, since they are “just getting started”. As Amazon found out that customers prefer Dash Cart in large stores, it has already expanded Dash Cart to all Amazon Fresh stores as well as third-party grocers. And customers prefer Just Walk Out in small stores, so it’s available now in 140+ thrid-party locations. Customers love Amazon One’s security and convenience regardless the scale of stores, so it’s now available at 500+ Whole Foods Market stores, some Amazon stores, and 150+ third-party locations.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Meta released early versions of Llama 3. Pretrained and instruction-fine-tuned Llama3 with 8B and 70B parameters are now open-source. Its 405B version is still training.</p>
<p>Llama 3 introduces Grouped Query Attention (GQA), which reduces the computational complexity of processing large sequences by grouping attention queries. Llama 3 also had extensive pre-training involving over 15 trillion tokens, including a significant amount of content in different languages, enhancing its applicability across diverse linguistic contexts. Post-training techniques include finetuning and rejection sampling which refine the model’s ability to follow instructions and minimize error. </p>

<p>Mistral AI’s Mixtral 8x22B has a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture, which maximize efficiency by activating only 44B out of 176B parameters. The model’s architecture ensures that only the most relevant “experts” are activated during specific tasks. The experts are individual neural networks as apart of SMoE model. They are trained to become proficient at particular sub-tasks out of the overall task. Since only a few experts are engaged for any given input, this design reduces computational complexity.</p>

<p><em>The race to lead A.I. has become a desperate hunt for the digital data needed to advance the technology. To obtain that data, tech companies including OpenAI, Google and Meta have cut corners, ignored corporate policies and debated bending the law, according to an examination by The New York Times.</em></p>
<p><em>Tech companies are so hungry for new data that some are developing “synthetic” information. This is not organic data created by humans, but text, images and code that A.I. models produce — in other words, the systems learn from what they themselves generate.</em></p>

<p>OpenAI developed a speech recognition tool ‘Whisper’ to transcribe the audio from YouTube videos, generating text data for AI system. Google employees know OpenAI had harvested YouTube videos for data but they didn’t stop OpenAI because Google had also used transcripts of YouTube videos for training AI models. Google’s rules about the legal usage of YouTube videos is vague and OpenAI’s employee were wading into a legal gray area.</p>
<p>As many tech companies such as Meta and OpenAI reached the stage of data shortage, OpenAI started to train AI models by using synthetic data synthesized by two different AI models, one produces the data, the other judges the information.</p>

<p><em>One page of the Microsoft presentation highlights a variety of “common” federal uses for OpenAI, including for defense. One bullet point under “Advanced Computer Vision Training” reads: “Battle Management Systems: Using the DALL-E models to create images to train battle management systems.” Just as it sounds, a battle management system is a command-and-control software suite that provides military leaders with a situational overview of a combat scenario, allowing them to coordinate things like artillery fire, airstrike target identification, and troop movements. The reference to computer vision training suggests artificial images conjured by DALL-E could help Pentagon computers better “see” conditions on the battlefield, a particular boon for finding — and annihilating — targets.</em></p>
<p><em>OpenAI spokesperson Liz Bourgeous said OpenAI was not involved in the Microsoft pitch and that it had not sold any tools to the Department of Defense. “OpenAI’s policies prohibit the use of our tools to develop or use weapons, injure others or destroy property,” she wrote. “We were not involved in this presentation and have not had conversations with U.S. defense agencies regarding the hypothetical use cases it describes.”</em></p>
<p><em>Microsoft told The Intercept that if the Pentagon used DALL-E or any other OpenAI tool through a contract with Microsoft, it would be subject to the usage policies of the latter company. Still, any use of OpenAI technology to help the Pentagon more effectively kill and destroy would be a dramatic turnaround for the company, which describes its mission as developing safety-focused artificial intelligence that can benefit all of humanity.</em></p>

<p><em>Microsoft scientists developed what they call a qubit virtualization system. This combines quantum error-correction techniques with strategies to determine which errors need to be fixed and the best way to fix them.</em></p>
<p><em>The company also developed a way to diagnose and correct qubit errors without disrupting them, a technique it calls “active syndrome extraction.” The act of measuring a quantum state such as superposition typically destroys it. To avoid this, active syndrome extraction instead learns details about the qubits that are related to noise, as opposed to their quantum states, Svore explains. The ability to account for this noise can permit longer and more complex quantum computations to proceed without failure, all without destroying the logical qubits.</em> </p>

<p>This week, the speed of releasing LLMs becomes about 10 per week. This article provides good explanation about why we don’t need to keep up with it or test all released models. Car is a good analogy to AI model nowadays. There are all kinds of brands and sizes, and designed for different purposes. Hundreds of cars are released every year, but you don’t need to know them. Majority of the models are not groundbreaking but whenever there is big step, you will be aware of it. </p>
<p>Although not necessary to catch up all the news, we at least need to be aware of the main future model features - where modern and future LLMs are heading to: 1) multimodality 2) recall capability 3) reasoning.</p>

<p> <em>If someone whom you don’t trust or an adversary gets something more powerful, then I think that that could be an issue. Probably the best way to mitigate that is to have good open source AI that becomes the standard and in a lot of ways can become the leader.

<p>What I learned from this interview: The future of Meta AI would be a kind of AI general assistant product where you give it complicated tasks and then it goes away and does them. Meta will probably build bigger clusters. No one has built 1GW data center yet but building it could just be a matter of time. Open source can be both bad and good. People can use LLM to do harmful things, while what Mask worries more about is the concentration of AI, where there is an untrustworthy actor having the super strong AI. Open source software can make AI not getting stuck in one company but can be broadly deployed to a lot of different systems. People can set standards on how it works and AI can get checked and upgraded together. </p>

<p><em>It is clear that inference was going to be a scaled problem. Everyone else had been looking at inference as you take one chip, you run a model on it, it runs whatever. But what happened with AlphaGo was we ported the software over, and even though we had 170 GPUs vs 48 TPUs, the 48 TPUs won 99 out of 100 games with the exact same software. What that meant was compute was going to result in better performance. And so the insight was - let’s build scaled inference.</em></p>
<p><em>(Nvidia) They have the ecosystem. It’s a double-sided market. If they have a kernel-based approach they already won. There’s no catching up. The other way that they are very good is vertical integration and forward integration. What happens is Nvidia over and over again decides that they want to move up the stack, and whatever the customers are doing, they start doing it.</em></p>
<p><em>Nvidia is incredible at training. And I think the design decision that they made including things like HBM, were really oriented around the world back then, which was everything is about training. There weren’t any real world application. None of you guys were really building anything in the wild where you needed super fast inference.</em></p>
<p><em>What we saw over and over again was you would spend 100% of your compute on training, you would get something that would work well enough to go into production, and then it would flip to about 5%-10% training and 90%-95% inference. But the amount of training would stay the same, the inference would grow massively. And so every time we would have a success at Google, all of a sudden, we would have a disaster, we called it the success disaster, where we can’t afford to get enough compute for inference.</em></p>
<p><em>HBM is this High Bandwidth Memory which is required to get performance, because the speed at which you can run these applications depends on how quickly you can read that into memory. There’s a finite supply, it’s only for data centers, so they can’t reach into the supply for mobile or other things, like you can with other parts. Also Nvidia is the largest buyer of super caps in the world and all sorts of other components. The 400 gigabit cables, they’ve bought them all out. So if you want to compete, it doesn’t matter how good of a product you design, they’ve bought out the entire supply chain for years.</em></p>
<p><em>The biggest difference between training and inference is when you are training, the number of tokens that you are training on is measured in month, like how many tokens can we train on this month. In inference, what matters is how many tokens you can generate per millisecond or a couple milliseconds.</em> </p>
<p><em>It’s fair to say that Nvida is the exemplar in training but really isn’t yet the equivalent scaled winner in inference.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to get the latency down, we had to design a completely new chip architecture, we had to design a completely new networking architecture, an entirely new system, an entirely new runtime, an entirely new compiler, and entirely new orchestration layer. We had to throw everything away and it had to be compatible with PyTorch and what other people actually developing in.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Facebook announced that by the end of this year, they are going to have the equivalent of 650000 H100s. By the end of this year, Grok will have deployed 100000 of our LPUs which do outperform the H100s on a throughput and on a latency basis. So we will probably get pretty close to the equivalent of Meta ourselves. By the end of next year, we are going to deploy 1.5M LPUs, for comparison, last year Nvidia deployed a total of 500000 H100s. So 1.5M means Grok will probably have more inference GenAI capacity than all of the hyperscalers and clouds service providers combined. So probably about 50% of the inference compute in the world.</em></p>
<p><em>I get asked a lot should we be afraid of AI and my answer to that is, if  you think back to Galileo, someone who got in a lot of trouble. The reason he got in trouble was he invented the telescope, popularized it, and made some claims that we were much smaller than everyone wanted to believe. The better the telescope got the more obvious it became that we were small. In a large sense, LLMs are the telescope for the mind, it’s become clear that intelligence is larger than we are and it makes us feel really really small and it’s scary. But what happened over time was as we realized the universe was larger than we thought and we got used to that, we started to realize how beautiful it was and our place in the universe. And I think that’s what’s going to happen. We’re going to realize intelligence is more vast than we ever imagined. And we are going to understand our place in it, and we are not going to be afraid of it.</em></p>

<p>This is a very insightful conversation especially in the part of comparison of training and inference. The answer to the final question is fascinating to end the conversation. A great takeaway that “intelligence is a telescope for the mind, in that we realize that we are small, while then also opportunity to see intelligence is vast and to not be afraid of it.”.</p>

<p><em>Economic value is getting disintegrated, there no value in foundational models economically. So then the question is who can build on top of them the fastest. Llama was announced last Thursday, 14 hours later Groq actually had that model deployed in the Groq Cloud, so that 100K+ developers could start building on it. That’s why that model is so popular. It puts the closed models on their heels. Because if you can’t both train and deploy iteratively and quickly enough, these open source alternatives will win, and as a result the economic potential that you have to monetize those models will not be there.  - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>By open-sourcing these models they limit competition because VCs are no longer going to plow half a billion dollars into a foundational model development company, so you limit the commercial interest and the commercial value of foundational models. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>AI is really two markets - training and inference. And inference is going to be 100 times bigger than training. And Nvidia is really good at training and very miscast at inference. The problem is that right now we need to see a capex build cycle for inference, and there are so many cheap and effective solutions, Groq being one of them but there are many others. And I think why the market reacted very negatively was that it did not seem that Facebook understood that distinction, that they were way overspending and trying to allocate a bunch of GPU capacity towards inference that didn’t make sense. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>You want to find real durable moats not these like legal arrangement that try to protect your business through these types of contracts. One of the reasons why the industry moves so fast is best practices get shared very quickly, and one of the ways that happens is that everybody is moving around to different companies (average term of employment is 18-36 months). There are people who violate those rules (taking code to the new company etc), and that is definitely breaking the rules, but you are allowed to take with you anything in your head, and it is one of the ways that best practices sort of become more common. - David Sacks</em></p>

<p>Apple proposed the ReALM model with 80M, 250M, 1B, and 3B parameters. It can be used on mobile devices and laptops. The task of ReALM is “Given relevant entities and a task the user wants to perform, we wish to extract the entity (or entities) that are pertinent to the current user query. “. The relevant entities can be on-screen entities, conversational entities, and background entities. The analysis shows that ReALM beats MARRs and has similar performance with GPT-4.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Google introduced the next generation transformer - infini-transformer. It’s able to take infinite length of input without the requirement of more memory or computation. Unlike vanilla attention mechanism in traditional transformer which reset their attention memory after each context window to manage new data, infini-attention retains a compressive memory and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms. The model compresses and reuses key-value states across all segments, allowing it to pull relevant information from any part of the document.</p>

<p><em>AI agents are starting to transcend their digital origins and enter the physical world through devices like smartphones, smart glasses, and robots.

</blockquote>
<p>The OpenEQA introduced by Meta is the first open vocab benchmark dataset for the formulation of Embodied Question Answering (EQA) task of understanding environment either by memory or by active exploration, well enough to answer questions in natural language. Meta also provided an automatic LLM-powered evaluation protocol to evaluate the performance of SOTA models like GPT-4V and see whether it’s close to human-level performance.</p>
<p>OpenEQA looks like the very first step towards “world model” and I’m excited that it’s coming. The dataset contains over 1600 high-quality human generated questions drawn from over 180 real-world environments. If the future AI agent can answer N questions over N real-world environments, where N is approximately infinity, we can call it God intelligence. But we are probably not able to achieve that “world model” at least with my limited imagination, because it requires un-infinite compute resources and there can be ethical issues. However, if we take one step back, instead of creating “world model”, a “human society model” or “transformation model”, etc, sounds more possible. Limiting question to a specific pain point problem and limiting environment according to it would both save resources and contribute AI’s value to human society.</p>

<p>OpenELM is a small language model (SLM) tailored for on-device applications. The models range from 270M to 3B parameters, which are suitable for deployment on mobile devices and PCs. The key innovation is called “layer-wise scaling architecture”. It allocates fewer parameters to the initial transformer layers and gradually increases the number of parameters towards the final layers. This approach optimizes compute resources while remaining high accuracy. Inference of OpenELM can be run on Intel i9 workstation with RTX 4090 GPU and an M2 Max MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Microsoft launched Phi-3 family including mini (3.8B), small (7B), and medium (14B). These models are designed to run efficiently on both mobile devices and PCs. All models leverage a transformer decoder architecture. The performance is comparable to larger models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT3.5. It supports a default of 4K context length but is expandable to 128K through LongRope technology. The models are trained on web data and synthetic data, using two-phase approach which enhances both general knowledge and specialized skills (e.g. logical reasoning), and fine tuned in specific domains. Mini (3.8B) is especially optimized for mobile usage, requiring 1.8GB memory when compressed to 4-bits and processing 12+ tokens per second on mobile devices such as iPhone 14.</p>

          <p>There is always a lot to learn about strategic thinking from Zuck. Here are some of his smart strategies behind open source I’ve learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc6uFV9CJGg">interview</a>, Zuck’s point of open source is to avoid concentration of AI while he didn’t ignore the harmful consequences of open source saying that it’s our responsibility to do a good job of reducing harm. There are several benefits of open source, one is that people could figure out cheaper ways to develop models so it won’t cost too much resource. The other benefit is that they could enable more efficient developments and vertical use cases in a lot of different systems. Take Google and Apple for example, their mobile ecosystems restrict what developers could build or what features they could launch on them.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>For companies like Meta with well-established network effect, they really don’t need to have the best model. AI’s content creation potential benefits Meta’s platforms, even if the models are not exclusively theirs. </li>
<li>By open-sourcing models, Meta started developer communities which can contribute to whatever the ecosystem Meta built and help solidify the advantage of it. Most recent example is the open model of Horizon OS which powers its VR headsets. It allows developers and creators to take advantage of these technologies to create MR experiences and grow business on it. Then Meta Quest Store can be quickly established.</li>
<li>Open source eventually makes economic value of foundational model disintegrated. There will be no value in foundational model economically and there is probably less point for VC to plow billions of dollars into a foundational model development startup. The potential economic values are in 100K+ developers iteratively and quickly training and deploying the open source models for specific business use cases. Inference will be way more important than training. So attention and money will be less concentrated to products like OpenAI GPT series and Nvidia training GPU but more on Cloud platforms with inference GPU for personal and business usage.</li>
</ol>

          <p>Looking at various LLM models developed in the past few months, we are absolutely pursuing LLM with larger number of parameters. This is counterintuitive to the concept of ‘parsimony’ in traditional machine learning, which means using a minimum number of parameters necessary to train the model therefore preventing overfitting problem on unseen data. But as we’ve all seen that in computer vision and natural language processing, generative models with larger number of parameters tend to outperform their more parsimonious counterparts. There are probably two main hypotheses: 1) increasing the amount of data can improve the performance of LLM, then the huge size of dataset requires large number of parameters otherwise the model is going to be underfitting, and 2) large number of parameters allow the model to generate high-resolution pictures, provide more detailed answers, gain the capability of solving more intricate problems.</p>
<p>The paper “Scaling Law for Neural Language Models” published in 2020 by OpenAI introduced the concept of scaling law - the performance of NLM is highly correlated with the scale of network, the size of dataset, and compute, but weakly correlated with model architecture (number of layers, depth, and width). There’s been a debate on this scaling law. OpenAI believes that parameter size is more important - for every x10 increase of compute, dataset size should be increased by x1.8, and parameter size should be increased by x5.5. However, DeepMind believes that they are equally important - for every x10 increase of compute, dataset size and parameter size should both be increased by x3.16.</p>
<p>The paper “Bigger is not Always Better: Scaling Properties of Latent Diffusion Models” published by Google this month summarized an investigation of scaling law on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) specifically. It points out that “when operating under a given inference budget, smaller models frequently outperform their larger equivalents in generating high-quality results”. It turns out that with the same compute capacity, smaller model with large number of training steps can outperform larger model with small number of training steps. The existence of trade-off here is due to the fact that total compute is proportional to the number of training steps times GFLOPS (number of rounds of one forward propagation and one back propagation). But with the same number of training steps, it’s still true that the larger model the better performance. As the expense is calculated roughly by the parameter size times dataset size, this finding opens up new pathways to enhance LDM’s generative capacity within limited inference budgets.</p>

          <p>I have read a lot of news and articles, and watched a few interviews regarding AI safety these days. The future of AI is promising. People are working towards more powerful AI and personalized AI assistants or agents. At the same time, AI causes problems. A very obvious downside of AI is people could use AI to do harmful things, but I think we are good to work together and prevent that from different angles such as legal aspect or open source software. I worry more about things that are not easily avoided and cannot be seen at least in these years when AI is still immature - which is being too early to rely on AI and thus deviating from truth. For example, it is too soon for us to lose faith in jobs like teachers, historians, journalists, writers, etc, but I’m concerning we are already losing faith in those jobs because of the development of AI and some violations of copyrighted work. As we have seen that AI could have wrong understanding of facts, have biased opinions, and make things up that don’t exist, we lives could fight for the truth but the dead cannot speak for themselves. It would be pathetic if human live in hallucination in the future, and I don’t know if there’s any good practice to prevent it. It’s like Pandora’s box is opened and complications cannot be stopped. But we should at least think seriously about the potential impact of AI on society and human consciousness and possible unexpected consequences.</p>

<p>Sometimes people who are doing hard data work may forget to step back and look at the big picture. This is a common mistake because we can definitely go from scientific data analysis to actionable insight for making better business decision. But we need to have some additional thoughts about whether the decision is a global optima or it’s just local due to the limited sample, restricted project goal, or restricted team scope.</p>

<p><em>When I decided to end my voluntary immersion in the driver community, I could not shake the feeling that the depersonalization of app workers is a feature, not a bug, of an economic model born of and emboldened by transformations that are underway across the global economy. This includes increasingly prevalent work arrangements characterized by weak employer-worker relations (independent contracting), strong reliance on technology (algorithmic management, platform-mediated communication), and social isolation (no coworkers and limited customer interactions).</em></p>
<p><em>As forces continue to erode traditional forms of identity support, meaningful selfdefinition at work will increasingly rely on how we collectively use and misuse innovative technologies and business models.</em><br><em>For example, how can companies deploy algorithmic management in a way that doesn’t threaten and depersonalize workers? How can focusing on the narratives that underlie and animate identities help workers reimagine what they really want and deserve out of a career coming out of the pandemic and the Great Resignation? Will increasingly immersive and realistic digital environments like the metaverse function as identity playgrounds for workers in the future? How will Web3 broadly, and the emergence of novel forms of organizing specifically (e.g., decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs), affect the careers, connections, and causes that are so important to workers? What role can social media platforms, online discussion forums, and other types of virtual water coolers play in helping independent workers craft and sustain a desirable work identity? In short, how can we retain the human element in the face of increasingly shrewd resource management tactics?”</em></p>

<p>This reminds me that last year when I was on vacation in LA, I’ve talked to a driver worked for both Lyft and Uber in LA. He complained Lyft’s route recommendation algorithm is shitty, not helpful at all, a waste of time, while Uber is better in comparison. At that time I realized how important it is to strengthen employer worker relations and gather feedback from workers or clients on the product improvement.<br>This is a great article where the author raises his concerns of dehumanization of workers in the future. While technology is advancing and economy is transforming, we don’t expect people to forget who they are in their daily basis work.</p>

<p><em>There are two ways of “solving” this problem. First, you can time the market, and wait until the ecosystem matures— though you risk waiting a long time. Second, you can drive the market, or supply all the necessary inputs and complements yourself.</em></p>

<p>Here are two examples. To drive the market, Musk supplies both electric vehicles and charging stations. Zuckerberg proposed the concept of metaverse and changed his company’s name.</p>

<p><em>This is where Musk’s Wall Street critics might say he’s weakest. Many of his businesses don’t articulate a clear logic, which is demonstrated by the unpredictable way these businesses ultimately reach solutions or products.</em></p>
<p><em>Musk has spelled out some of his prior logic in a set of “Master Plans,” but most of the logical basis for exactly how he will succeed remains ambiguous. But this isn’t necessarily Musk’s fault or due to any negligence per se: When pursuing new technologies, particularly ones that open up a new market, there is no one who can anticipate the full set of possibilities of what that technology will be able to do (and what it will not be able to do).</em></p>

<p>Elon is interesting, but I have to say that we human need this type of person to leap to the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What could he possibly want with Twitter? The thing is, over the last decade, the technological landscape has changed, and how and when to moderate speech has become a critical problem-and an existential problem for social media companies.

<p>This is a great article which profiles Elon Musk specifically in his strategies and vision. It answered my question confusing me for two years: what was Musk thinking on buying Twitter? The answer is: Musk’s vision is not in pursuit of a specific type of solution but is in pursuit of a specific type of problem. If we go back to 2016, Igor as a CEO of Disney decided not to buy Twitter because he looked at Twitter as the solution: a global distribution platform, while concerned the quality of speech on it is a problem. Musk was looking for challenges and complexities while Igor was preventing them and looking for solutions.</p>

We don’t run ads on our free version. We don’t monetize it in other ways. I think that kind of ‘open’ is very important, and is a huge deal for how we fulfill the mission. “― Sam</em></p>

So adaptive that when you transfer if could very quickly adapt to the physical world.”― Ilya</em></p>
<p><em>“The real world that I would imagine is one where humanity are like the board members of a company where the AGI is the CEO. The picture I would imagine is you have some kind of different entities, countries or cities, and the people who live there vote for what the AGI that represents them should do. You could have multiple AGIs, you would have an AGI for a city, for a country, and it would be trying to in effects take the democratic process to the next level.” “(And the board can always fire the CEO), press the reset button, re-randomize the parameters.”― Ilya</em></p>

<p>I watched Lex’s interview with Sam Altman uploaded on March 18, 2024, and an older interview with Ilya Sutskever happened 3 years ago. Elon’s lawsuit against OpenAI frustrated Sam but Sam is optimistic about the future and everything he is going to release in the next few months. Sam answered the questions “what does open mean in OpenAI” that ‘open’ mainly means putting powerful tech in the hands of people for free as a public good, but not necessarily mean open-source. He said there can be open-source models or closed-source models. About the transition between non-profit to capped for-profit, Sam said OpenAI is not setting a precedent for startup to mimic it but he suggested most startups should go for for-profit directly if they pursue profitability in the beginning.</p>
<p>Ilya’s interview is more interesting to me because he talked a lot about vision, tech, philosophy in Deep Learning. It’s impressive that he had such thoughts 3 years ago. </p>

<p><em>Speech is one kind of liability for companies using generative AI. The design of these systems can create other kinds of harms—by, say, introducing bias in hiring, giving bad advice, or simply making up information that might lead to financial damages for a person who trusts these systems.</em></p>
<p><em>Because AIs can be used in so many ways, in so many industries, it may take time to understand what their harms are in a variety of contexts, and how best to regulate them, says Schultz.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Section 230 of Communications Decency Act of 1996 has protected internet platforms from being held liable for the things we say on them, but it doesn’t cover speech that a company’s  AI generates. It’s likely that in the future companies use AI will be liable for whatever it does. It could be a driver of pushing companies to take effort to avoid problematic AI output, and reduce “hallucinations” (when GenAI makes stuff up). </p>
<p>A very obvious downside is people could use AI to do harmful things, but I think people are good to work together and prevent that from different angles such as legal aspect or open source software. I worry more about things that are potential or cannot be seen at least in these years when AI is still immature - which is being too early to rely on AI and deviating from truth. For example, it is too soon for people to lose faith in jobs like teachers, historians, journalists, writers, etc, but I’m concerning people are already losing faith in those jobs because of the development of AI and some violations of copyrighted work. As we have seen that AI could have wrong understanding of facts, have biased opinions, and make things up that don’t exist, we lives could fight for the truth but the dead cannot talk. </p>

<p><em>We know from our past experiences that big things start small. The biggest oak starts from an acorn. If you want to do anything new, you’ve got to be willing to let that acorn grow into a little sapling and then into a small tree and maybe one day it will be a big business on its own.</em></p>
<p><em>He was a free thinker whose ideas would often run against the conventional wisdom of any community in which he operated.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve always actually found something to be very true, which is most people don’t get those experiences because they never ask. I have never found anybody who didn’t want to help me when I’ve asked them for help. I have never found anyone who said no or hung up the phone when I called. I just asked. And when people ask me, I try to be as responsive, to pay back that debt of gratitude. Most people never pick up the phone and call. Most people never ask. That is what separates the people that do things from the people that just dream about them. You’ve got to act and you’ve got to be willing to fail. You’ve got to be ready to crash and burn with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. If you’re afraid of failing, you won’t get very far.</em></p>
<p><em>His company and its computer into something aspirational. He links this machine made a few months earlier, a few months ago by some disheveled California misfits to Rolls Royce, the 73 year old paragon of sophisticated industrial manufacturing and elite consumer taste. He even calls Apple a world leader, an absolutely unprovable claim that rockets the little company into the same league as IBM, which was then the industry’s giant. He was an extraordinary speaker and he wielded that tool to great effect.</em></p>
<p><em>People that are learning machines and they refuse to quit are incredibly hard to beat.</em></p>
<p><em>When you have something that’s working, you do not talk about it. You shut up because the more you talk about it, the more broadcasting you do about it, the more it encourages competition.</em></p>
<p><em>The only purpose for me in building a company is so that the company can make products. One is a means to the other. Over a period of time, you realize that building a very strong company and a very strong foundation of talent and culture in a company is essential to keep making great products. The company’s one of the most amazing inventions of humans, this abstract construct that’s incredibly powerful. Even so, for me, it’s about the products. It’s about working together with really fun, smart, creative people and making wonderful things. It is not about the money. What a company is, then, is a group of people who can make more than just the next big thing. It is a talent. It is a capability. It is a culture. It is a point of view. And it is a way of working together to make the next thing and the next one and the next one.</em></p>
<p><em>In that case, Steve would check it out, and the information he’d glean would go into the learning machine that was his brain. Sometimes, that’s where it would sit and nothing would happen. Sometimes, on the other hand, he’d concoct a way to combine it with something else that he’d seen or perhaps to twist it in a way to benefit an entirely different project altogether. This was one of his great talents, the ability to synthesize separate developments and technologies into something previously unimaginable.</em></p>
<p><em>I felt I had let the previous generations of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce, and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure and even thought about running away from the Valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me. I still love what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love, and so I decided to start over.</em></p>

<p><em>It helps if you can be satisfied with an inner scorecard, I would also say it’s probably the only – the single only way to have a happy life.</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted money. It could make me independent then I could do with what I wanted to do with my life. And the biggest thing I wanted to do was work for myself. I didn’t want other people directing me. The idea of doing what I wanted to do every day was very important to me.</em></p>
<p><em>I like to work by myself where I could spend my time thinking about things I wanted to think about. Washington was upsetting at first, but I was in my own world all the time. I could be sitting in a room thinking or could be writing around flinging things and thinking.</em></p>
<p><em>Walt Disney seldom dabbled. Everyone who knew him remarked on his intensity. When something intrigued him, he focused himself entirely on it as if it were the only thing that mattered.</em></p>
<p><em>Intensity is the price of excellence.</em></p>
<p><em>People ask me where they should go to work, and I always tell them to go work for whom they most admire.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s like saving sex for your old age, do what you love and work for whom you admire the most, and you’ve given yourself the best chance in life you can.</em></p>
<p><em>You’ll get very rich if you thought of yourself as having a card with only 20 punches in a lifetime, and every financial decision used up one punch. You will resist the temptation to dabble. You make more good decisions, and you would make more big decisions.</em></p>
<p><em>Instead, he said, basically, when you get to my age, you’ll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. I know people who have a lot of money, and they get testimonial dinners and they get hospital wings named after them. But the truth is that nobody in the world loves them. If you get to my age and life and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big your bank account is.</em></p>
<p><em>Your life is a disaster. That’s the ultimate test of how you’ve lived your life. The trouble with love is you can’t buy it. You can buy sex. You can buy testimonial dinners. You can buy pamphlets that say how wonderful you are, but the only way to get love is to be lovable. It is very irritating if you have a lot of money. You’d like to think you could write a check. I’ll buy $1 million worth of love, please, but it doesn’t work that way.</em></p>
<p><em>The more you give love away, the more you get.</em></p>

<p><em>Amazon’s single-threaded leadership: “The basic premise is that for each project, there is a single leader whose focus is that project and that project alone. And that leader oversees teams of people whose attention is similarly focused on that one project.”</em></p>
<p><em>Similar idea in Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One: “The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. Every employee’s one thing was unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing. I had started doing this just to simplify the task of managing people, but then I noticed a deeper result. Defining roles reduced conflict.”</em></p>
<p><em>“When your dependencies keep growing, it’s only natural to try speeding things up by improving your communication. We finally realize that all of this cross-team communication didn’t really need refinement at all. It needed to be eliminated. It wasn’t just that we had the wrong solution in mind. Rather, we’ve been trying to solve the wrong problem altogether.”</em></p>
<p><em>Jeff’s vision was that we needed to focus on loosely coupled interaction via machines through well-defined APIs rather than via humans through e-mails and meetings. This would free each team to act autonomously and move faster.</em></p>
<p><em>From his 2016 shareholder letter, Jeff suggested that most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong, may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.</em></p>
<p><em>“The best way to fail and inventing something is by making it somebody’s part-time job. And so the problem that they were trying to solve and the vision they had was how to move faster and remove dependencies, but what they also realized once this was in place, that ownership and accountability are much easier to establish under the single-threaded leader model.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there.” “Long-term thinking levers are existing abilities and lets us do new things we couldn’t otherwise contemplate. Long-term orientation interacts well with customer obsession. If we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that the need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution.”</em></p>
<p><em>Invention works well where differentiation matters. Differentiation with customers is often one of the key reasons to invent.</em></p>
<p><em>Working backwards exposes skill sets that your company needs but does not have yet. So the longer that your company works backwards, the more skills it develops and the more skills it develops, the more valuable it becomes over time.</em></p>
<p><em>Founders force the issue. Not outsourcing means it’s going to be more expensive, going to spend a lot of or money. It’s going to take longer to get a product out there. But at the end of that, if we are successful, we have a set of skills that we lacked beforehand, then we can go out and do this over and over again.</em></p>

<p><em>“My passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products. Everything else was secondary. Sure, it was great to make a profit because that’s what allowed you to make great products. But the products, not the profits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to make money.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s a subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything, the people you hire, who gets promoted, what you discuss in meetings. Some people say, give the customer what they want, but that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, ‘If I asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, a faster horse.’ People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page. Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science. I like that intersection. There’s something magical about that place.”</em></p>
<p> <em>“There are a lot of people innovating, and that’s not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple resonates with people is that there’s a deep current of humanity in our innovation. I think great artists and great engineers are similar in that they both have a desire to express themselves. In fact, some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicians on the side.”</em> </p>
<p><em>“In the ‘70s, computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great at science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor. At different times in the past, there were companies that exemplified Silicon Valley. It was Hewlett-Packard for a long time. Then in the semiconductor era, it was Fairchild and Intel. I think that it was Apple for a while, and then that faded. And then today, I think it’s Apple and Google and a little more so Apple. I think Apple has stood the test of time. It’s been around for a while, but it’s still at the cutting edge of what’s going on.”</em> </p>
<p><em>“It’s easy to throw stones at Microsoft, and yet I appreciate what they did and how hard it was. They were very good at the business side of things. They were never as ambitious product-wise as they should have been. Bill likes to portray himself as a man of the product, but he’s really not. He’s a businessperson. Winning business was more important than making great products. He ended up the wealthiest guy around. And if that was his goal, then he achieved it. But it’s never been my goal. And I wonder in the end if it was his goal.”</em> </p>
<p><em>“I admire him for the company he built. It’s impressive, and I enjoyed working with him. He’s bright and actually has a good sense of humor. But Microsoft never had the humanities and liberal arts in its DNA. Even when they saw the Mac, they couldn’t copy it well. They totally didn’t get it. I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field. And then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing great salesmen because they’re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So the salespeople end up running the company. When the sales guys run the company, the product guys don’t matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It happened at Apple when Sculley came in, which was my fault. Apple was lucky, and it rebounded. I hate it when people call themselves entrepreneurs when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public so they can cash in and move on. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business. That is how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You build a company that will stand for something a generation or two from now. That’s what Walt Disney did and Hewlett and Packard and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That’s what I want Apple to be. I don’t think I run roughshod over people. But if something sucks, I tell people to their face. It is my job to be honest. I know what I’m talking about, and I usually turn out to be right. That’s the culture I try to create. We are brutally honest with each other, and anyone can tell me they think I’m full of s***, and I can tell them the same.”</em></p>
<p><em>“And we’ve had some rip-roaring arguments where we were yelling at each other and it’s some of the best times I’ve ever had. I feel totally comfortable saying, ‘Ron, that story looks like s,’ in front of everyone else. Or I might say, ‘God, we really fed up the engineering on this,’ in front of the person that’s responsible. That’s the ante for being in the room. You’ve got to be able to be super honest. Maybe there’s a better way, a gentlemen’s club, where we all wear ties and speak in soft language and velvet code words. But I don’t know that way because I’m middle class from California.”</em> </p>
<p><em>“I was hard on people sometimes, probably harder than I needed to be. I remember the time when my son was six years old, coming home, I had just fired somebody that day. And I imagined what it was like for that person to tell his family and his young son that he had lost his job. It was hard, but somebody has got to do it. I figured that it was always my job to make sure that the team was excellent. And if I didn’t do it, nobody was going to do it. You always have to keep pushing to innovate.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Bob Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn’t. He had to move on. And when he did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966 Europe tour was his greatest. He would come on and do a set of acoustic guitars and the audience loved him. Then he would do an electric set and the audience booed. There was one point where he was about to sing Like a Rolling Stone and someone from the audience yells, “Judas,” and Dylan says, ‘Play it f***ing loud,’ and they did. The Beatles were the same way. They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That is what I’ve always tried to do. Keep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, ‘If you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying.’”</em></p>
<p><em>“What drove me? I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that’s been done by others before us. I didn’t invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to that flow. It’s about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That is what has driven me.”</em></p>
<p><em>“He was not a model boss or human being, tightly packaged for emulation. Driven by demons, he would drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and passions and products were all interrelated. His tale is thus both instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t focus too much on being pragmatic. Logical thinking has its place but really go on intuition and emotion. I began to realize that an intuitive understanding and consciousness was far more significant than abstract thinking and intellectual logical analysis.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Whatever he was interested in, he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.”</em></p>
<p><em>Charlie Munger says, “In business, we often find that the winning system goes almost ridiculously far in maximizing or minimizing one or a few variables.”</em></p>
<p><em>“He made me do something I didn’t think I could do. It was the brighter side of what would become known as his reality distortion field. If you trust him, you can do things,” Holmes said. “If he decided that something should happen, then he’s just going to make it happen.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then it will work. I told him, pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Jobs had a bravado that helped him get things done, occasionally by manipulating people. He could be charismatic, even mesmerizing, but also cold and brutal. Jobs was awed by Wozniak’s engineering wizardry and Wozniak was awed by Jobs’ business strive. I never wanted to deal with people and step on toes. But Steve could call up people he didn’t know and make them do things.”</em></p>
<p><em>“In order to do a good job of those things that we decide to do, we must eliminate all the unimportant opportunities.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want and you go forward with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think.”</em></p>
<p><em>The reality distortion field was a confounding combination of a charismatic rhetorical style, indomitable will and an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand.</em></p>
<p><em>“Jobs is a strong world elitist artist, who doesn’t want his creations mutated inauspiciously by unworthy programmers. It would be as if someone off the street added some brush strokes to a Picasso painting or changed the lyrics to a Bob Dylan song.”</em></p>
<p><em>“If you want to live your life in a creative way, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away. The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times artists have to say, ‘Bye, I have to go. I’m going crazy, and I’m getting out of here.’ And then they go hybrid somewhere. Maybe later, they reemerge a little differently.”</em></p>

<p><em>The qubit in superposition has some probability of being 1 or 0, but it represents neither state, just like our quarter flipping into the air is neither heads nor tails, but some probability of both. A quantum computer can use a collection of qubits in superpositions to play with different possible paths through a calculation. If done correctly, the pointers to incorrect paths cancel out, leaving the correct answer when the qubits are read out as Os and 1s.</em></p>
<p><em>Grover’s algorithm, a famous quantum search algorithm, could find you in a phone book of 100 million names with just 10,000 operations. If a classical search algorithm just spooled through all the listings to find you, it would require 50 million operations, on average.</em></p>
<p><em>Qubits have to be carefully shielded, and operated at very cold temperatures-sometimes only fractions of a degree above absolute zero. A major area of research involves developing algorithms for a quantum computer to correct its own errors, caused by glitching qubits.</em></p>
<p><em>Some researchers, most notably at Microsoft, hope to sidestep this challenge by developing a type of qubit out of clusters of electrons known as a topological qubit. Physicists predict topological qubits to be more robust to environmental noise and thus less error-prone, but so far they’ve struggled to make even one.</em></p>
<p><em>Teams in both the public and private sector are betting so, as Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft have all expanded their teams working on the technology, with a growing swarm of startups such as Xanadu and QuEra in hot pursuit. The US, China, and the European Union each have new programs measured in the billions of dollars to stimulate quantum R&amp;D. Some startups, such as Rigetti and lonQ, have even begun trading publicly on the stock market by merging with a so-called special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC-a trick to quickly gain access to cash.</em></p>
<p><em>Chemistry simulations may be the first practical use for these prototype machines, as researchers are figuring out how to make their qubits interact like electrons in a molecule. Daimler and Volkswagen have both started investigating quantum computing as a way to improve battery chemistry for electric vehicles. Microsoft says other uses could include designing new catalysts to make industrial processes less energy intensive, or even pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change. Tech companies like Google are also betting that quantum computers can make artificial intelligence more powerful.</em></p>
<p><em>Big Tech companies argue that programmers need to get ready now. Google, IBM, and Microsoft have all released open source tools to help coders familiarize themselves with writing programs for quantum hardware. IBM offers online access to some of its quantum processors, so anyone can experiment with them. Launched in 2019, Amazon Web Services offers a service that connects users to startup-built quantum computers made of various qubit types over the cloud. In 2020, the US government launched an initiative to develop a K-12 curriculum relating to quantum computing. That same year, the University of New South Wales in Australia offered the world’s first bachelor’s degree in quantum engineering.</em></p>

<p>This article is pretty comprehensive in describing quantum computing mechanism and techniques. One interesting fact is that quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into bank accounts and breaking encryption and cryptography. Shor’s algorithm has been proven mathematically that if you had a large enough quantum computer, you could find the prime factor of large numbers - the basis of RSA encryption, the most commonly used thing on the internet. Although we are far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute Shor’s algorithm on that scale, cryptography research has already been preparing for quantum computers’ code-breaking capabilities.</p>

There are pros and cons of open sourcing LLM, just like last year OpenAI open sourced Stable Diffusion which has a lot of bad potential influences.

<p>Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture which helps the model to process large datasets by activating relevant neural network segments. It’s capable of managing up  to 1M tokens - equivalent to 700000 words, one hour of video, or 11 hours of audio. What’s exciting is that it leverages a transformer-based architecture with a specifically designed long context window, which allows it to remember and process vast amounts of information. It’s able to achieve tasks like summarizing lectures from lengthy videos. It’s really able to retrieve ‘needles’ from a ‘haystack’ of millions of tokens across different structures of data sources with accuracy of 99%.</p>

<p>Apple Vision Pro launched on Feb 2, 2024 at $3,499. It’s interesting that Meta and Apple are starting on opposite ends of the spectrum. Meta quest has the right price and will try to improve the technology overtime. Apple Vision Pro has the right technology and will try to lower the price overtime. With a price of 3499, Apple is targeting the high end of the market, not aiming for a mass market product in the first iteration. Instead their sights are set on the early adaptors. It’s a pattern that most Apple products take several years to achieve the mass production. The first iteration of iPhone in 2007 was a soft launch. iPhone didn’t crack 10M units per quarter until the iPhone 4 in late 2010. Now Apple sells about 200M iPhones every year. So it’s highly possible that mass adoption of technologically improved mixed-reality headsets with more affordable pricing is coming in a decade.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Researcher from Google and Quantinuum demonstrated a mechanism needed for a component called a topological qubit, which should promise a means to maintain and manipulate information encoded into quantum states more robustly than existing hardware designs. Topological qubits store and work with digital information in non-Abelian anyons, which retain a sort of “memory” of their past movement that enables the representation of binary data. While physicists previous proved the existence of non-Abelian anyons, Quantinuum’s and Google’s work are the first to demonstrate their signature feature, memory of movement. However, people disagreed that topological qubit has been created because the object was too fragile for practical use and cannot reliably manipulate information to achieve practical quantum computing. Delivering a practical topological qubit will require all kinds of studies of non-Abelian anyons and the math underpinning their quirky behavior. Technological breakthrough can be expected after incremental progress.</p>
<p>Google Quantum Al’s paper published in May 2023 is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05954-4">here</a> and no I’m not going to read this theoretical physics paper :)</p>

<p><em>Apple’s rivals, such as Samsung, are gearing up to launch a new kind of “AI smartphone” next year. Counterpoint estimated more than 100 million AI-focused smartphones would be shipped in 2024, with 40 percent of new devices offering such capabilities by 2027.</em></p>
<p><em>Optimizing LLMs to run on battery-powered devices has been a growing focus for AI researchers. Academic papers are not a direct indicator of how Apple intends to add new features to its products, but they offer a rare glimpse into its secretive research labs and the company’s latest technical breakthroughs.</em></p>
<p><em>“Our work not only provides a solution to a current computational bottleneck but also sets a precedent for future research,” wrote Apple’s researchers in the conclusion to their paper. “We believe as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, approaches like this work will be essential for harnessing their full potential in a wide range of devices and applications.”</em></p>

<p>Apple is developing solutions to running LLM or other AI models directly on a customer’s iPhone. The published paper is titled “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11514.pdf">LLM in a Flash</a>“. Apple’s focus is different from Microsoft’s and Google’s focus of developing Chatbots and GenAI over the Internet from cloud computing platform. I think the smartphone market would be revived and customer experience would be largely changed in the future with this potential vision of personalized and mobile AI agents &#x2F; assistants. If this personalized little AI agent can learn everything about a person from childhood to adult, can we eventually get a perfect adult mind? It reminds me of what Alan Turing said about AI: </p>
<p><em>“Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.”</em></p>

<p><em>Since the beginning of 2017, China has chalked up more than 18 million EV sales, nearly half the world’s total and over four times more than the US, according to BloombergNEF data. By 2026, the research group projects that over 50% of all new passenger vehicle sales in China will be electric, compared to a little over a quarter in the US.</em></p>
<p><em>The growth of the network was both a result of state planning and private enterprise. Giant state-owned companies like State Grid Corp. of China were given mandates to roll out chargers, while private companies like Qingdao TGOOD Electric Co. jumped at the chance to build charging posts—in part to lay early claim to the best locations. Baidu’s mapping software—the Chinese equivalent of Google Maps—has them all integrated, delivering constant reminders of where to go. Payment is typically via an app or the ubiquitous WeChat platform.</em></p>
<p><em>Demand for new lithium-ion batteries is expected to increase about five-fold between 2023 and 2033, according to Julia Harty, an energy transition analyst at FastMarkets. Meeting that will require recycling as well as mining.</em></p>

<p>I haven’t been back to China for 3 years, and last time (2021) there are just a few EVs. Maybe a few years later there are only a few gasoline cars left on the roads. The transition from gasoline cars to electrical vehicles won’t be fast but the peak of sales for gasoline cards is coming soon in China. </p>

<p><em>In its complaint, The Times said it approached Microsoft and OpenAI in April to raise concerns about the use of its intellectual property and explore “an amicable resolution,” possibly involving a commercial agreement and “technological guardrails” around generative A.I. products.</em></p>
<p><em>The lawsuit could test the emerging legal contours of generative A.I. technologies — so called for the text, images and other content they can create after learning from large data sets — and could carry major implications for the news industry.</em> </p>
<p><em>“If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill,” the complaint reads. It adds, “Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”</em></p>

<p>There is always a group of people who are positively working on changing the world while another group of people who are suspicious and concerned. Every lawsuit in AI field allows us to hold on and reflect whether we are doing the right things and how to fix the problems along the way of innovation and development. It is a good point that if intellectual property of journalism is not well-protect while AI is still in its immature stage with a lot of mistakes in text learning and generation, then less journalism will be produced, and less truths will be revealed and documented. The damage to the society is enormous.</p>

<p><em>Per the IRS, for-profit entities and not-for-profit entities are fundamentally at odds with each other, so in order to combine the two competing concepts, OpenAl came up with a novel structure which allowed the non-profit to control the direction of a for-profit entity while providing the investors a “capped” upside of 100x. This culminated in a $1Bn investment from Microsoft, marking the beginning of a key strategic relationship, but complicating the company’s organizational structure and incentives.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This article (Quick Essay: A Short History of OpenAI) reviewed the history of OpenAl from 2015 when it’s founded to 2023 when Sam was once fired. A crucial development happened in 2018 when the company first introduced the foundational architecture of GPT in a paper “Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training”. This leads to the flagship product of the company - ChatGPT, in Nov 2022. In 2019 OpenAl transited from nonprofit to a “capped-profit” model. This novel convoluted corporate structure led to conflicting motivations and incentives within the company and it latter raised board’s concern about company’s commitment to safety.</p>
<p>Sam Altman was fired on Nov 17, 2023. On Nov 19, 2023, OpenAl hired former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as its interim CEO. Meanwhile Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that they would hired Sam to lead a new Al department. On Nov 20, 2023, Nearly all 800 OpenAl employees signed a letter calling for the resignation of the company’s board and the return of Altman as CEO. On Nov 21, 2023, Sam returned as CEO of OpenAl.</p>
<p>One story in 2020: Two of the lead Al developers Amodei and his sister Daniela left OpenAl in late 2020 to launch Anthropic over concerns the company was moving too quickly to commercialize its technology. Anthropic was founded aiming to develop more safer and trustworthy model and it has billions invested from Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Zoom, etc.</p>
<p>Since Sam was rehired, the questions about neglecting Al safety has been quieted, and new board members appear to be more focused on profitability. There is no doubt of OpenAl’s capability of profitably scaling ChatGPT, but it should raise doubts about whether OpenAl is still committing to its purpose in the future. </p>
<p>Sutskever was recruited to OpenAl from Google in 2015 by Elon Musk, who describes him as “the linchpin for OpenAl being successful”. A tweet from Greg Brockman confirms that Ilya was a key figure in Altman’s removal. But Sutskever also a signee calling Sam back to CEO. He later said he deeply regret his participation in the board’s actions.</p>

          <p>Hello World, </p>
<p>This is Di, living in my 25th year of life. I’m INTJ.</p>
<p>It’s been half a year since I graduated from school and started my career. School life and work life are drastically different but both of them are fascinating. I have changed a lot after school in many things such as habit and mindset. But one habit never changes is daily reading and learning. (Here are some of my pre-25-year-old notes: <a href="https://jokerdii.github.io/">https://jokerdii.github.io/</a>) </p>
<p>I still remember at the time when ChatGPT released I was taking “Quantitative Methods in NLP” course at MIT. Then I observed AI waves got stronger in 2023. Technology changed rapidly throughout the year with one great paper followed by another. And human’s life started to change rapidly as well. I don’t know whether it is because a lot of things going on outside, my mind is excited and spinning with full of information every single day. </p>
<p>I never had a habit of taking diary in my life. I didn’t film my life and I use social media only for chatting and “friend making”. But I finally decided to start it specifically for documenting what I read and learned in my spare time. And it is for me internal use only because 1) I’d like to write something as an output to make sure my brain exactly gets the input, and 2) I’d like to document great things because my brain has a very limited memory.</p>
