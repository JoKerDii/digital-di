<p><strong>Playing defense: How to control the narrative if your work is being questioned - Wes Kao’s Newsletter</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/playing-defense-how-to-control-narrative">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s normal that people will misunderstand and disagree with you. what we need to do is to 1) learn to explain your ideas better and 2) stay calm and share your thought process in the most objective way possible.</p>
<p>Defending your thinking means to share logic, evidence and rationale that explains why you believe your conclusion is the right one. It’s not to try to protect your ego by refusing to acknowledge a good argument, and being delusional about the strength of your claim. Being able to play defense is important because it’s about your credibility. If you do it well you are building more trust, otherwise you will be diminishing trust.</p>
<p>Some suggestions mentioned in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>﻿﻿Have a rationale of every small decision you made.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Try to anticipate questions.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Embrace “show, not tell”</li>
<li>﻿﻿React as positively as possible. e.g.<br> “Ah! I’m so glad you asked”.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Consider the question behind the question.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Be happy that the person voiced their concern.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Beware of insecure vibes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you overcompensate, you’ll come across as defensive. This decreases your credibility too. You’ll need to use your judgment and read the situation. An open, curious, and almost playful attitude shows you’re not afraid of hard questions.</p>
<p>Many people underestimate the daily moments where your credibility can either be reinforced or eroded. This might sound dramatic, but it’s quite banal: Every interaction folks have with you gets added to their subconscious cumulative repository of data points about you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Insecure vibes are subconscious clues and signals that you might be giving off when you’re feeling anxious, nervous, or uncertain. Get rid of insecure vibes—and your writing, meetings, presentations, negotiations, and pitches will become stronger.</em></p>
<p><strong>― “Insecure vibes” are a self-fulfilling prophecy - Wes Kao’s Newsletter</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/insecure-vibes-are-a-self-fulfilling">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following situations, insecure vibes happen: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>When other person touched on your sore spot and you feel threatened</p>
</li>
<li><p>You assume the person will say no before you even start</p>
<p>This can make you talk fast - showing you enter the conversation already playing defense. You don’t give the person a chance to say yes because you’ve already said no to yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You insist on email or slack when you know a phone call is better</p>
<p>Explaining your point in writing is a sign of lacking confidence and avoiding confrontation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You over-explain because you expect the other person to be skeptical</p>
<p>You bring up counterpoints to arguments no one has mentioned. Not a good time to do so. It looks like you intentionally bring up something new to surprise others rather than having a reasonable justification of your point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid being doubtful if you actually feel confident:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t preface your idea with too many caveats. Speak in complete sentences. Remove “ands” and “buts” that create never-ending sentences, which can sound less authoritative. </li>
<li>Notice if you start to ramble. Try to prepare the first few lines of what you want to say to kick off a meeting, so you start strong. </li>
<li>Practice your actual script so you get comfortable saying those words.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get rid of insecure vibes, ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>Could this be interpreted as sounding defensive?</li>
<li>Am I overcompensating or overexplaining?</li>
<li>How would I respond on my best day?</li>
<li>Would I say this if I felt secure?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strategy, not self-expression: How to decide what to say when giving feedback - Wes Kao’s Newsletter</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/strategy-not-self-expression">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself “Is this strategy or self expression?” before giving feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not self-express your feeling or complain. Do not say anything that does not motivate them to change. Instead, say things that get you closer to changing the person’s behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to focus on strategy rather than self-expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mentally forgive this person</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identify what is most likely to motivate them to change, </p>
</li>
<li><p>Say only 10% that will actually change behavior, thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this make them even more effective?</li>
<li>How will this allow them to work even better with the people around them?</li>
<li>How does this get them closer to their goals?</li>
<li>How is this a skill they can apply now and in all future roles?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t trigger the defensiveness in the first place</p>
<p>The minute your recipient gets defensive, it becomes a lot harder to undo the defensiveness and get them to accept what you’re saying. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Let the other person talk, e.g.  “I’d love to hear what you think. What parts are resonating most with you?”</p>
<p>The other benefit of letting the other person talk is <em>cognitive dissonance</em>: if they say out loud what they are committed to doing differently, they are reinforcing the idea in their own mind. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep your eyes on the person’s behavior change</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always be framing</p>
<p>“Strategy, not self-expression” applies to many more situations too.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Every week, we make business cases at work. I’m defining a business case as any recommendation to pursue a business opportunity or solve a problem. A business case can be a 5-page document, 5 sentences in Slack, or a 5-minute phone call. The larger the project, the more you may need to make a comprehensive business case. But the underlying premise is the same: If you don’t explain why a problem matters, your colleagues won’t have the necessary information to decide how to support you.</em></p>

<p><strong>Paramount Merges With Skydance - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/paramount-merges-with-skydance">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PARA agreed to merge with Skydance. The new CEO is Skydance Media CEO David Ellison whose father Larry Ellison is the founder of Oracle. </p>
<p>Old paramount businesses: 1) filmed entertainment (Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon movie), 2) TV media (Paramount’s broadcast) and cable television networks, like CBS and MTV, 3) Direct to consumer streaming services like Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Its current problems: 1) flat revenue, 2) streaming services are losing, 3) high long-term debt but low cash.</p>
<p>New Paramount Plan: 1) unify marquee rights, 2) reorganize finance, 3) transition into a tech-media hybrid.</p>
<p>For the #3, the vision is to better position Paramount on the front end (DTC apps) and the back end (cloud infrastructure, cloud-based production, and AI tools). Specifically, they are going to 1) rebuild DTC into a differentiated platform, 2) build studio-in-the-cloud, 3) leverage Gen AI.</p>

<p><strong>Fintech Shake-Up - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/fintech-shake-up">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple Pay unveiled a new peer-to-peer (P2P) feature called “Tap to Cash”, which is a natural evolution of the existing “Tap to Pay”.   This is not the only case where big tech offers features that directly compete with financial institutions: Google Wallet, Amazon’s lending program for sellers, etc, competing with PayPal’s Venmo, Block’s Cash App, etc. Big tech’s move not only intensifies competition within P2P payment, but also raises questions about the future of the payment industry.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visa and Mastercard both face mobile wallet threats to card-based business model.</li>
<li>American Express renowned for its premium card offerings, targeting high spending high credit quality customers, continuing to attract millennials and Gen Z customers. The recent strategic acquisitions are Tock (a reservation platform for high end restaurant and events) and Rooam (a mobile payment and ordering platform for restaurants and venues). However, it’s sensitive to economic downturns and facing competitions for other premium card issuers and digital payment platforms. </li>
<li>Fiserv’s merchant solutions and financial solutions look positive, it’s actively investing in digital transformation, and it recently acquired BentoBox (a digital marketing and commerce platform for restaurants).</li>
<li>Adyen serves large enterprise clients with its unified commerce platform</li>
<li>PayPal lowered its FY 2024 guidance. It’s facing a decline in active accounts. To solve this, it focuses on strategic partnerships such as collaboration with Apple. It’s facing competitive pressure from Big Tech payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay. It’s currently undergoing significant restructuring such as layoffs and leadership change. And it’s initiating AI-powered personalized ads platform and strengthening relationships with SME customers.</li>
<li>Block’s growth is driven by its momentum of Cash App ecosystem, square ecosystem, and significant investment in Bitcoin. However, it’s facing challenges of regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency activities and compliance practices, competition from established competitors and fintech startups, needs of balancing growth and profitability given FY 2024 guidance.</li>
</ol>
<p>What to watch for the shift in payment landscape:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facing legal battle from Big Tech, can Visa and Mastercard find innovation or new solutions to maintain their revenue streams from swipe fee?</li>
<li>Will Digital Wallet dominant payment industry? Will traditional cards remain or be replace?</li>
<li>New possibilities of payments have been developed such as Buy Now and Pay Later (BNPL). Will innovations gain mainstream adoption in payment industry?</li>
<li>Can the challenges of cryptocurrencies be overcome? Will cryptocurrencies be mainstream adoption?</li>
<li>As consumers are demanding seamless, secure, cheaper, and personalized payment experiences, companies that can provide such services will become successful in the future.</li>

<p>Broadcom now operates across two primary segments: 1) semiconductor solutions (chips for networking, server storage, broadband, wireless communication, and industrial applications), and 2) infrastructure software (a explosive leap with the acquisition of VMware). </p>
<p>Highlights: VMware acquisition brings significant revenue to Broadcom; AI as a great growth driver; jumbo acquisition resulted in gigantic net debt; strong cash generation; 10-for-1 stock split on July 15. </p>
<p>Future: Next-generation products include Tomahawk and Jericho; supply chain disruption and inflation resulted from macroeconomic environment; regulatory scrutiny into VMware acquisition.</p>

<li>the boycott impact: losing 1.5M loyal customers, as a result of the fact that in October 2023, Starbucks became embroiled in a controversy related to the ongoing violence in the Middle East, </li>
<li>significant loss in traffic from non-Rewards members due to additional reasons such as awareness of daily drink price, gourmet coffee boom, health-conscious consumers, changing work habits, and competitors with coffee offerings in lower prices. Solutions on this are new initiatives such as physical and digital enhancements like updated POS system, siren system speedup, and opening mobile orders beyond its loyalty programs.</li>
<li>Price war in Chinese coffee market e.g. Luckin Coffee.</li>

<p><em>You cannot spend this kind of money and show no incremental revenue potential. So while this is incredible for NVIDIA, the chicken is coming home to roast, because if you do not start seeing revenue flow to the bottom line of these companies that are spending 26 B dollars a quarter, the market cap of NVIDIA is not what the market cap of NVIDIA should be, and all of these other companies are going toe get punished for spending this kind of money. Where are all these new fangled things that we are supposed to see that justifies a hundred billion dollar of chip spend a year, two hundreds billion dollars of energy spend, a hundred billion dollars of all this other stuff, we are now spending 750 billion dollars. This is on the order of a national transfer payment, and we’ve seen nothing to show for it except that you can mimic somebody’s voice. It doesn’t all hang together yet. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>There’s gaps in the quality of the products that can be created to not have hallucination. Those gaps are too large right now for them to be used reliably in production settings unless you have a very defined scope. If you have a defined scope though, the implementation costs are not nearly what needs the level of spend to support. So there is just a big mismatch. Second is that we have a huge problem with NVIDIA, which is you can’t spend this kind of money to have tech lock-in to one hardware vendor, and that makes no sense. And what you are seeing now is that Amazon Google Microsoft AMD Intel, a plethora of startups Grok, everybody trying to make now different hardware solution. The problem though is that we have this massive lock-in right now, because the code is littered with all these NVIDIA specific ways of implementing access to GPUs, that’s not sustainable. So we are in an existential thrash and I think the only way that we are going to get around this is to do a little bit of a reset. And I think that’s going to touch a lot of startups that have already taken down way too much money at really insane valuations. I think we are in a bit of a reckoning right now it’s going to be complicated couple of quarters to at a minimum and probably a complicated year to sort out who’s actually real. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>There is ton of capital that was raised during the covid bubble era, and the ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) era, that needed a place to go. And a lot of traditional business model, traditional in the technology sense - SAS and a lot of biotech stuff, it became uninvestable. Then there is a lot of money in the public markets that was sitting on the sidelines, that was sitting in treasuries and so on. So every dollar is looking for growth and there is a lot of dollars still sitting around out there from the ZIRP era and the coming into this kind of post ZIRP era, looking for a place to growth. And there is very little growth as we talked about with the S&amp;P 479 not being very performative with respect to growth and revenue and having great outlook for the next five years. So then when there is a glimmer of upside there is a glimmer of opportunity, even if it’s just painting a picture of a growth story, all the capital drives into it. And we’ve all heard stories about these series a startups in AI, getting bit up to a 100M valuation. I’ve seen a couple of these where people have pitch me things on like protein modeling AI startups, and it’s literally like two guys from meta and openai that left and started this company, and they raised 30 on a 12 per year or something, and it’s just two guys building a model. That’s because that capital needs to find a place where it can tell itself a growth story. So I think we are still dealing with the capital hangover from ZIRP. And the fact there is an area to invest for real growth that has allowed the AI bubble to grow as quickly as it has. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>Now as Chamath points out we are kind of rationalizing that back and I do think that there is going to be a reset. Now I’ll also say that the Goldman report which I read and some of the other analyses that have been done. I think there was some commentary or some analysis that hey it costs me six times as much as having an analyst do this work. The energy cost of the AI is still so high, the actual performance of the model is not good. What that fails to write it’s right and wrong. It’s right in the sense that yes it’ s more expensive today and ROI is not there today. It’s wrong in that it ignores the performative model improvements that we’re seeing in nearly any metric over the past couple of months. Every few months as we know we see new models, new improvements, new architectures, new ways to leveraging the chips to actually drive a lover token cost, to drive lower energy cost per answer, lower energy cost per run. Every metric that matters is improving, so if you fast forward another 24 or 36 months, I do think that there is a great reason to be optimistic that there is going to be extraordinary ROI based on the infrastructure that’s being built. It’s a question of are you going to get payback before the next cycle of infrastructure needs to be made and everything comes back in. We saw this during the dotcom boom where a lot of people built out data centers and by the time they were able to actually able to make money on those data centers, it was like hey all the new Telco equipment, all the new servers needs to be put in, and everything got written off. So there is a big capex kind of question mark here, but I do think that the fundamental economics of AI will be proven over the next couple of quarters. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>I’m much more bullish than you guys about this investment that’s being made. Remember that when the internet got started in the 90s, it was via dialup. I mean you literally had to have a modem and you would dial up the internet and it was incredibly slow. Photo sharing didn’t even work, so social networking wasn’t possible. And basically what happened next was that the Telecom company spent a ton of money building out broadband and people started upgrading to broadband. Then we had the Doom crash everyone thought that telecom companies had wasted billions of dollars investing in all this Broadband infrastructure. And it turned out that no they were right to do that, it just took a while for that to get used and this is a pretty common pattern with technological revolutions is that you can have a bubble in the short term but then it gets justified in the mid to long term. The build out of the railroads in the United States another example of this we had huge railroad bubbles but it turned out that that investment was all worthwhile. - David Sacks</em></p>

<p>Sharing good insights about AI, David’s amazing story with Poker, some great career advice. And happy birthday to David Friedberg!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We talked a little bit about it with Jonathan height. There’s some great studies that have shown in the past that the change in income is a better predictor of happiness than absolute income. Eventually everything normalizes so I think UBI makes no sense for three reasons. The first is this normalization of spending level. So once you’ve kind of had this increase, you have a moment of happiness, and then you actually start spending differently or spending more. And effectively every human has one innate trait desire. And desire is what drives humanity. It’s what drives progress. It’s what pushes us forward because no matter what our absolute condition, it’s our relative condition that matters relative to others or relative to ourselves in the past or perspectively in the future. And so we always want to improve our condition. So a UBI based system basically gives a flat income so the only way for it to really work is if you increase the income automatically by say 10% a year. So in a UBI world, no amount of money will actually make someone satisfied or meet their minimum thresholds because those minimum thresholds will simply shift. And you know the second issue is just the net economic effect if we gave 350 million Americans 1000 bucks a month, that’s $350 billion a month, that’s $4 trillion a year. Our prospective budget for next year is 7.3 trillion at the federal level, so you know that’s already more than 50% of the total projected federal budget next year finding the mechanism for funding this at scale is not what this study actually looked at. Because if you look at it the net effect would be inflationary. And that’s the third major reason is that ultimately this would have an inflationary effect anytime. We’ve stimulated the economy with outside money. With government-driven money, we see many bubbles emerge and we see an inflationary effect. So look at covid, there were all these little bubbles that popped up in the financial markets, we had NFTs, we had crypto, we had all these sort of new places that money found its way to and then we had an aggregate inflationary effect food prices are still up 30 40% since covid. And so I think that the study provides an interesting insight into the micro effect the psychological effects, the social effect, but macro effects are what is so like simply arithmetically obvious, which is inflation and an inability to actually fund us at scale. And fundamentally people want to work so they’ll take that money, and then they’ll go find ways to work and generate more money, and you have this inflationary effect so I think UBI does not make sense. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>That’s not UBI right and what you’re describing I think exist and there are incentives and programs and opportunities out there people can sign up with Roth IRAs they can contribute some percentage of their paycheck to a 401k. If they have a job that has a 401k setup for them there’s a lot of systems and mechanisms out there and you get tax breaks for doing that. So there’s mechanisms and incentives out there to do that sort of thing the concept with UBI is can you pay people a flat amount of money so that they don’t have to work, and then they end up being able to explore and do other things with their life as the robots and AI does everything for them. And I’ve just always been of the belief that I don’t think that there’s this natural border that we hit beyond which humans don’t work. I think that AI based tools and automation tools are the same as they’ve always been. When we developed a tractor people didn’t stop farming. They could get much more leverage using the tractor and farm more. And new jobs and new Industries emerged. And I expect that the same thing will happen with this next evolution of technology and human progress. Humans will find ways to create new things to push themselves forward to drive things forward. And for the natural market-based incentives that fundamentally are rooted in this internal system of Desire will create new opportunities that we’re not really thinking about so I don’t believe in this idea of UBI in some utopian world where everyone’s happy not working and letting machines do everything for them I think that the fundamental sense of a human is to find purpose, and to realize that purpose to drive themselves forward and progress themselves. And I think that that’s always going to be the case. - David Friedberg</em></p>

<p><em>In any massive failure there are a host of smaller errors that compound; in this case, CrowdStrike created a faulty file, failed to test it properly, and deployed it to its entire customer base in one shot, instead of rolling it out in batches. Doing something different at each one of these steps would have prevented the widespread failures that are still roiling the world</em></p>
<p><em>The real issue, though, is more fundamental: erroneous configuration files in userspace crash a program, but they don’t crash the computer; CrowdStrike, though, doesn’t run in userspace: it runs in kernel space, which means its bugs crash the entire computer — 8 million of them, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/">according to Microsoft</a>.

<p>This team generated 1B personas based on web info and stored them into a Persona Hub. They introduced a synthetic data generation method called ‘persona-driven data synthesis’. These personas can be potentially used to 1) generate personalized content, 2) support LLM prompting, 3) enhance product research, 4) create NPCs in games. The compression perspective is more interesting and helpful for understanding the approach: Persona Hub can be seen as the compressed form of the world knowledge into distributed carriers. And the public web text can be seen as the decompressed content created by these personas with their knowledge and experiences.</p>

<p>This is one of the most surprising breakthrough in this AI and LLM year. AlphaProof got a silver medal in IMO. It’s a neurosymbolic system -  a combination of Google’s Gemini LLM and DeepMind’s Alpha Zero, so it uses LLM to generate plausible solutions and uses self-play style to search for the right one. It opens a research direction of AI use cases, which has been discussed about by many AI frontier experts and companies, which is “scientific discovery”. Mastering math can be the first step of expanding frontier of our knowledge. OpenAI’s Strawberry project seems to have the same ambitions.</p>

          <p>I’ve never looked so deeply into my feelings inside until I met this book written by Brené Brown. I fell in love with it immediately when I saw the quote from Theodore Roosevelt at the very beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again… who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The courage to be vulnerable is not about winning or losing, it’s about the courage to show up when you can’t predict or control the outcome. The only thing I know for sure after all of this research is that if you’re going to dare greatly, you’re going to get your ass kicked at some point. If you choose courage, you will absolutely know failure, disappointment, setback, even heartbreak. That’s why we call it courage. That’s why it’s so rare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definition of rumbling with vulnerability. It’s a foundational and core skill of courage building, and “our ability to be daring leaders will never be greater than our capacity for vulnerability”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A rumble is a discussion, conversation, or meeting defined by a commitment to lean into vulnerability, to stay curious and generous, to stick with the messy middle of problem identification and solving, to take a break and circle back when necessary, to be fearless in owning our parts, and, as psychologist Harriet Lerner teaches, to listen with the same passion with which we want to be heard.</p>

<ol>
<li>Have the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The definition of vulnerability is the emotion that we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. Vulnerability is not winning or losing. It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Step over cheap-seat feedback and keep daring</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not in the arena getting your ass kicked on occasion, I’m not interested in or open to your feedback. There are a million cheap seats in the world today filled with people who will never be brave with their lives but who will spend every ounce of energy they have hurling advice and judgment at those who dare greatly. Their only contributions are criticism, cynicism, and fearmongering. If you’re criticizing from a place where you’re not also putting yourself on the line, I’m not interested in what you have to say.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t grab hurtful comments and pull them close to you by rereading them and ruminating on them. Don’t play with them by rehearsing your badass comeback. And whatever you do, don’t pull hatefulness close to your heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Don’t shield ourselves from all feedback</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, if we shield ourselves from all feedback, we stop growing. If we engage with all feedback, regardless of the quality and intention, it hurts too much, and we will ultimately armor up by pretending it doesn’t hurt, or, worse yet, we’ll disconnect from vulnerability and emotion so fully that we stop feeling hurt. When we get to the place that the armor is so thick that we no longer feel anything, we experience a real death. We’ve paid for selfprotection by sealing off our heart from everyone, and from everything-not just hurt, but love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The six misguided myths of vulnerability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vulnerability is weakness</li>
<li>I don’t do vulnerability</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing to own our vulnerability and do it consciously means learning how to rumble with this emotion and understand how it drives our thinking and behavior so we can stay aligned with our values and live in our integrity. Pretending that we don’t do vulnerability means letting fear drive our thinking and behavior without our input or even awareness, which almost always leads to acting out or shutting down.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>I can do it alone</li>
<li>You can engineer uncertainty out of vulnerability</li>
<li>Trust comes before vulnerability</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to trust to be vulnerable, and we need to be vulnerable in order to build trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust is the stacking and layering of small moments and reciprocal vulnerability over time. Trust and vulnerability grow together, and to betray one is to destroy both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I like this marble jar approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We trust the people who have earned marbles over time in our life. Whenever someone supports you, or is kind to you, or sticks up for you, or honors what you share with them as private, you put marbles in the jar. When people are mean, or disrespectful, or share your secrets, marbles come out. We look for the people who, over time, put marbles in, and in, and in, until you look up one day and they’re holding a full jar. Those are the folks you can tell your secrets to. Those are the folks you trust with information that’s important to you.</p>

<p>Leaders must either invest a reasonable amount of time attending to fears and feelings, or squander an unreasonable amount of time trying to manage ineffective and unproductive behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>Hunt treasures</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This is when I remember Joseph Campbell’s quote, which I believe is one of the purest calls to courage for leaders: “The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we are in fear or in self-protection, these are the patterns of how we assemble our armor. And they will NOT lead us to anywhere.</p>
<p>a. I’m not enough</p>
<p>b. If i’m honest about what’s happening, they will think less of me or maybe use it against me</p>
<p>c. No one else is going to be honest about what’s happening and so no way am I going to do that</p>
<p>d. They are not honest about what scares them and they’ve got a lot of issues</p>
<p>e. This is their fault and they are trying to blame me</p>
<p>f. I’m better than them</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Serve people</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When you find the courage to enter that cave, you’re never going in to secure your own treasure or your own wealth; you face your fears to find the power and wisdom to serve others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good practices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a one-on-one discussion</li>
<li>Stop talking. Leave long white pauses and empty space so that we can start peeling and going deep.</li>
<li>When they start talking. Really listen.</li>
<li>When we are in tough rumbles with people, we can’t take responsibility for their emotions.</li>
<li>When rumbles become unproductive, give everyone minutes to walk around outside or catch their breath.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Section-3-The-Armory"><a href="#Section-3-The-Armory" class="headerlink" title="Section 3. The Armory"></a>Section 3. The Armory</h2><blockquote>
<p>The problem is that when we imprison the heart, we kill courage. In the same way that we depend on our physical heart to pump life-giving blood to every part of our body, we depend on our emotional heart to keep vulnerability coursing through the veins of courage and to engage all of the behaviors we talked about in the prior section, including trust, innovation, creativity, and accountability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You got to put down the weapons and show up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As children we found ways to protect ourselves from vulnerability, from being hurt, diminished, and disappointed. We put on armor; we used our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors as weapons; and we learned how to make ourselves scarce, even to disappear. Now as adults we realize that to live with courage, purpose, and connection to be the person who we long to be-we must again be vulnerable. We must take off the armor, put down the weapons, show up, and let ourselves be seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forms of armored leadership with top three as perfectionism, foreboding joy, numbing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Driving Perfectionism (armored leadership) vs encouraging for healthy striving (daring leadership).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfectionism is not the same thing as striving for excellence. Perfectionism is not about healthy achievement and growth. Perfectionism is a defensive move.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfectionism is not the self-protection we think it is. It is a twenty-ton shield that we lug around, thinking it will protect us, when in fact it’s the thing that’s really preventing us from being seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfectionism is not self-improvement. Perfectionism is, at its core, about trying to earn approval. Most perfectionists grew up being praised for achievement and performance (grades, manners, rule following, people pleasing, appearance, sports). Somewhere along the way, they adopted this dangerous and debilitating belief system: I am what I accomplish and how well I accomplish it. Please. Perform. Perfect. Prove. Healthy striving is self-focused: How can I improve? Perfectionism is other-focused: What will people think? Perfectionism is a hustle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfectionism is not the key to success. In fact, research shows that perfectionism hampers achievement. Perfectionism is correlated with depression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis, or missed opportunities. The fear of failing, making mistakes, not meeting people’s expectations, and being criticized keeps us outside the arena where healthy competition and striving unfolds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Last, perfectionism is not a way to avoid shame. Perfectionism is a function of shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Squandering opportunities for joy and recognition (armored leadership) vs practicing gratitude and celebrating milestones (daring leadership).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Numbing (armored leadership) vs setting boundaries and finding real comfort (daring leadership)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot selectively numb emotion. If we numb the dark, we numb the light. If we take the edge off pain and discomfort, we are, by default, taking the edge off joy, love, belonging, and the other emotions that give meaning to our lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Propagating the false dichotomy of victim or viking (armored leadership) vs practicing integration - strong back, soft front, wild heart (daring leadership)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The opposite of living in a world of false binaries is practicing integration the act of bringing together all the parts of ourselves, as we talked about earlier. We are all tough and tender, scared and brave, grace and grit. The most powerful example of integrationa practice that I wrote about in Braving the Wilderness and that I try to live by-is strong back, soft front, wild heart.</p>
<p>How can we give and accept care with strongback, soft-front compassion, moving past fear into a place of genuine tenderness? I believe it comes about when we can be truly transparent, seeing the world clearly-and letting the world see into us.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Being a knower and being right (armored leadership) vs being a learner and getting it right (daring leadership)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Having to be the “knower” or always being right is heavy armor. It’s defensiveness, it’s posturing, and , worst of all, it’s a huge driver of bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Hiding behind cynicism (armored leadership) vs modeling clarity, kindness, and hope (daring leadership)</li>
<li>Using criticism as self-protection (armored leadership) vs making contributions and taking risks (daring leadership)</li>
<li>Using power over (armored leadership) vs using power with, power to, and power within (daring leadership)</li>
<li>Hustling for your worth (armored leadership) vs knowing your value (daring leadership)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When people don’t understand where they’re strong and where they deliver value for the organization or even for a single effort, they hustle. And not the good kind of hustle. The kind that’s hard to be around because we are jumping in everywhere, including where we’re not strong or not needed, to prove we deserve a seat at the table. When we do not understand our value, we often exaggerate our importance in ways that are not helpful, and we consciously or unconsciously seek attention and validation of importance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="10">
<li>Zigzagging and avoiding (armored leadership) vs talking straight and taking action (daring leadership)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Zigzagging is a metaphor for the energy we spend trying to dodge the bullets of vulnerability whether it’s conflict, discomfort, confrontation, or the potential for shame, hurt, or criticism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we find ourselves zigzagging-hiding out, pretending, avoiding, procrastinating, rationalizing, blaming, lying-we need to remind ourselves that running is a huge energy suck and probably way outside our values. At some point, we have to turn toward vulnerability and make that call.</p>

<p>First, shame is the fear of disconnection. As we talked about in the myths of vulnerability, we are physically, emotionally, cognitively, and spiritually hardwired for connection, love, and belonging. Connection, along with love and belonging, is why we are here, and it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. Shame is the fear of disconnection-it’s the fear that something we’ve done or failed to do, an ideal that we’ve not lived up to, or a goal that we’ve not accomplished makes us unworthy of connection.</p>
<p>Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love, belonging, and connection.</p>
<p>Retreating into our smallness becomes the most seductive and easiest way to stay safe in the midst of the shame squeeze. But, as we’ve talked about, when we armor and contort ourselves into smallness, things break and we suffocate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Behavioral cues that shame has permeated a culture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfectionism; Favoritism; Gossiping; Back-channeling; Comparison; Self-worth tied to productivity; Harassment; Discrimination; Power over;  Bullying; Blaming; Teasing; Cover-ups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shame resistance is not possible as long as we care about connection, but shame resilience is possible, learnable by all of us. We need to be empathy and self-compassion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shame resilience is the ability to practice authenticity when we experience shame, to move through the experience without sacrificing our values, and to come out on the other side of the shame experience with more courage, compassion, and connection than we had going into it. Ultimately, shame resilience is about moving from shame to empathy the real antidote to shame.</p>
<p>it’s important to understand that if we share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame can’t survive. Self-compassion is also critically important, but because shame is a social concept-it happens between people it also heals best between people. A social wound needs a social balm, and empathy is that balm. Self-compassion is key because when we’re able to be gentle with ourselves in the midst of shame, we’re more likely to reach out, connect, and experience empathy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of empathy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathy is not connecting to an experience, it’s connecting to the emotions that underpin an experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathy is a choice. And it’s a vulnerable choice, because if I were to choose to connect with you through empathy, I would have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling. In the face of a difficult conversation, when we see that someone’s hurt or in pain, it’s our instinct as human beings to try to make things better. We want to fix, we want to give advice.  But empathy isn’t about fixing, it’s the brave choice to be with someone in their darkness-not to race to turn on the light so we feel better.</p>
<p>If struggle is being down in a hole, empathy is not jumping into the hole with someone who is struggling and taking on their emotions, or owning their struggle as yours to fix. If their issues become yours, now you have two people stuck in a hole. Not helpful. Boundaries are important here. We have to know where we end and others begin if we really want to show up with empathy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathy is at the heart of connection-it is the circuit board for leaning into the feelings of others, reflecting back a shared experience of the world, and reminding them that they are not alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Empathy skills:</strong></p>
<p>From practical perspective, empathy is first to take the perspective of another person, second to stay out of judgment, third to understand their emotion, and fourth to communicate my understanding of their emotion.</p>
<ol>
<li>To see the world as others see it, or perspective taking</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Perspective taking requires becoming the learner, not the knower.</p>
<p>Again, it’s only when diverse perspectives are included, respected, and valued that we can start to get a full picture of the world, who we serve, what they need, and how to successfully meet people where they are.</p>
<p>I love what Beyoncé said in her first-person essay in the September 2018 issue of Vogue: ”If people in powerful positions continue to hire and cast only people who look like them, sound like them, come from the same neighborhoods they grew up in, they will never have a greater understanding of experiences different from their own. They will hire the same models, curate the same art, cast the same actors over and over again, and we will all lose. The beauty of social media is it’s completely democratic. Everyone has a say. Everyone’s voice counts, and everyone has a chance to paint the world from their own perspective.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>To be unjudgmental</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on research, there are two ways to predict when we are going to judge: We judge in areas where we’re most susceptible to shame, and we judge people who are doing worse than we are in those areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>To understand another person’s feelings</li>
<li>To communicate your understanding of that person’s feelings</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Fluency in emotional conversation means being able to name at least thirty of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason emotion is difficult to identify and name is the iceberg effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the emotions that we experience show up as pissed off or shut down on the surface. Below the surface, there’s much more nuance and depth. Shame and grief are two examples of emotions that are hard to fully express, so we turn to anger or silence.</p>
<p>The vast majority of us find it easier to be mad than hurt. Not only is it easier to express anger than it is to express pain, our culture is more accepting of anger. So the next time you’re shutting down or angry, ask yourself what lies beneath.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Mindfulness &#x2F; Paying attention</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Self-compassion skills</strong></p>

<li>Maintain clear line</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not take responsibility and ownership for the words of other people-just own your part.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jumping into the hole with no way out is enmeshment-jumping into struggle with someone while maintaining clear lines about what belongs to whom is empathy.</p>

<p>Four elements of shame resilience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognizing shame and understanding its triggers</li>
</ol>
<p>When we have understanding and awareness around shame, we are less likelyy to default to our shame shields or the following three strategies of disconnection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moving away: Withdrawing, hiding, silencing ourselves, and keeping secrets. Moving toward: Seeking to appease and please. Moving against: Trying to gain power over others by being aggressive, and by using shame to fight shame.</p>

<h2 id="Section-5-Curiosity-and-Grounded-Confidence"><a href="#Section-5-Curiosity-and-Grounded-Confidence" class="headerlink" title="Section 5. Curiosity and Grounded Confidence"></a>Section 5. Curiosity and Grounded Confidence</h2><blockquote>
<p>Dheeraj explained to me that when leaders don’t have the skills to lean into vulnerability, they’re not able to successfully hold the tension of the  paradoxes that are inherent in entrepreneurship. His examples of the paradoxes that elicit vulnerability in leaders align with what we heard from the research participants: • Optimism and paranoia • Letting chaos reign (the act of building) and reining in chaos (the act of scaling) • Big heart and tough decision making • Humility and fierce resolve • Velocity and quality when building new things • Left brain and right brain • Simplicity and choice • Thinking global, acting local • Ambition and attention to detail • Thinking big but starting small • Short-term and long-term • Marathons and sprints, or marathon of sprints in business-building Dheeraj told me, “Leaders must learn the skills to hold these tensions and get adept at balancing on the ‘tightrope’ of life. Ultimately, leadership is the ability to thrive in the ambiguity of paradoxes and opposites.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How to build skills to hold tensions of the paradoxes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rumble skills: easy learning does not build strong skills</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that to be effective, learning needs to be effortful. That’s not to say that anything that makes learning easier is counterproductive-or that all unpleasant learning is effective. The key here is desirable difficulty. The same way you feel a muscle “burn” when it’s being strengthened, the brain needs to feel some discomfort when it’s learning. Your mind might hurt for a while-but that’s a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Curiosity</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In his book Curious: The Desire to Know and Why Your Future Depends on It, Ian Leslie writes, “Curiosity is unruly. It doesn’t like rules, or, at least, it assumes that all rules are provisional, subject to the laceration of a smart question nobody has Yet thought to ask. It disdains the approved pathways, preferring diversions, unplanned excursions, impulsive left turns. In short, curiosity is deviant.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Practice vulnerability, become self-aware, and engage in tough conversations</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s an old saying that I lead by now: “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” I’ve learned one way to help people understand how much you care is to share your story.</p>

<h1 id="Part-2-Living-into-Our-Values"><a href="#Part-2-Living-into-Our-Values" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Living into Our Values"></a>Part 2. Living into Our Values</h1><p>Values and living into our values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A value is a way of being or believing that we hold most important. Living into our values means that we do more than profess our values, we practice them. We walk our talk-we are clear about what we believe and hold important, and we take care that our intentions, words, thoughts, and behaviors align with those beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More often than not, our values are what lead us to the arena door-we’re willing to do something uncomfortable and daring because of our beliefs. And when we get in there and stumble or fall, we need our values to remind us why we went in, especially when we are facedown, covered in dust and sweat and blood. Here’s the thing about values: While courage requires checking our armor and weapons at the arena door, we do not have to enter every tough conversation and difficult rumble completely empty-handed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three steps to help you know more about yourself and how to live into your values:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can’t live into values that we can’t name</li>
<li>Taking values from BC to behavior</li>
<li>Empathy and self-compassion: the two most important seats in the arena</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the values you pick, daring leaders who live into their values are never silent about hard things.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You first listen about race. You will make a lot of mistakes. It will be super uncomfortable. And there’s no way to talk about it without getting some criticism. But you can’t be silent.” To opt out of conversations about privilege and oppression because they make you uncomfortable is the epitome of privilege.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Silence is not brave leadership, and silence is not a component of brave cultures. Showing up and being courageous around these difficult conversations is not a path you can predetermine. A brave leader is not someone who is armed with all the answers. A brave leader is not someone who can facilitate a flawless discussion on hard topics. A brave leader is someone who says I see you. I hear you. I don’t have all the answers, but I’m going to keep listening and asking questions. We all have the capacity to do that. We all have the ability to foster empathy. If we want to do good work, it’s imperative that we continue to flesh out these harder conversations, to push against secrecy, silence, and judgment. It’s the only way to eradicate shame from the workplace, to clear the way for a performance in the arena that correlates with our highest values and not the fearmongers from the stands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest challenge we face when it comes to values is the necessity to give feedback and receive feedback. You have to know when you are ready to give feedback and be good at receiving feedback.</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand their values</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>You don’t really know people until you take the time to understand their values.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Daring leaders assume the best about people’s intention and assume they are doing the best they can. Leaders struggling with ego, armor, and&#x2F;or a lack of skills do not make that assumption.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the foundational skill of assuming the best in people? Setting and maintaining boundaries. What’s the fundamental belief underpinning the assumption of positive intent? That people are doing the best they can.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who are the most generous in their assumptions of others have the clearest boundaries. The most compassionate and generous people I’ve interviewed in my career are the most boundaries. It turns out that we assume the worst about people’s intentions when they’re not respectful of our boundaries: It is easy to believe that they are trying to disappoint us on purpose. However, we can be very compassionate toward people who acknowledge and respect what’s okay and what’s not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to boundaries, an assumption of positive intent relies on the core belief that people are doing the best they can with what they’ve got, versus that people are lazy, disengaged, and maybe even trying to piss us off on purpose. Sure, we’re all capable of change and growth, but assuming positive intent requires the belief that people are really trying in that moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming positive intent does not mean that we stop helping people set goals or that we stop expecting people to grow and change. It’s a commitment to stop respecting and evaluating people based solely on what we think they should accomplish, and start respecting them for who they are and holding them accountable for what they’re actually doing. And when we’re overwhelmed and struggling, it also means turning those positive assumptions toward ourselves: I’m doing the very best I can right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Part-3-Braving-Trust"><a href="#Part-3-Braving-Trust" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Braving Trust"></a>Part 3. Braving Trust</h1><p>Importance of talking about trust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because talking about trust is tough, and because these conversations have the potential to go sideways fast, we often avoid the rumble. And that’s even more dangerous. First, when we’re struggling with trust and don’t have the tools or skills to talk about it directly with the person involved, it leads us to talk about people instead of to them. It also leads to lots of energy-wasting zigzagging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To measure individual level of trustworthiness, you can refer to the following seven behaviors - BRAVING inventory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boundaries: You respect my boundaries, and when you’re not clear about what’s okay and not okay, you ask. You’re willing to say no. Reliability: You do what you say you’ll do. At work, this means staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you don’t overpromise and are able to deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities. Accountability: You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends. Vault: You don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share. I need to know that my confidences are kept, and that you’re not sharing with me any information about other people that should be confidential. Integrity: You choose courage over comfort. You choose what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy. And you choose to practice your values rather than simply professing them. Nonjudgment: I can ask for what I need, and you can ask for what you need. We can talk about how we feel without judgment. We can ask each other for help without judgment. Generosity: You extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unpacking Vault:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I walk into a co-worker’s office and spill, there might be a moment of connection, but it’s counterfeit connection. The second I walk out, that colleague is likely thinking, “I should be careful about what I tell Brené; she’s got no boundaries.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unpacking nonjudgment:</p>
<p>We are afraid of being judged for a lack of knowledge or lack of understanding, so we hate asking questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We asked a thousand leaders to list marble earning behaviors-what do your team members do that earns your trust? The most common answer: asking for help. When it comes to people who do not habitually ask for help, the leaders we polled explained that they would not delegate important work to them because the leaders did not trust that they would raise their hands and ask for help.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust is built in small moments. If you struggle with reliability, make small and doable promises to yourself that are easy to fulfill, until you get a flywheel of reliability going again. If you struggle with boundaries, set small ones with your partner-like you will not be responsible for both cooking and cleaning up dinner-until you are adept at putting boundaries into action in a more meaningful way. That’s how you fill your own marble jar. And never forget-we can’t give people what we don’t have.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Part-4-Learning-to-Rise"><a href="#Part-4-Learning-to-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Learning to Rise"></a>Part 4. Learning to Rise</h1><blockquote>
<p>We can’t expect people to be brave and risk failure if they’re not prepped for hard landings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: If we don’t have the skills to get back up, we may not risk falling. And if we’re brave enough often enough, we are definitely going to fall. The research participants who have the highest levels of resilience can get back up after a disappointment or a fall, and they are more courageous and tenacious as a result of it. They do that with a process that I call Learning to Rise. It has three parts: the reckoning, the rumble, and the revolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three steps process for learning to rise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we have the courage to walk into our story and own it, we get to write the ending. And when we don’t own our stories of failure, setbacks, and hurt-they own us.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The Reckoning</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The reckoning is as simple as that: knowing that we’re emotionally hooked and then getting curious about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ego doesn’t own stories or want to write new endings; it denies emotion and hates curiosity. Instead, the ego uses stories as armor and alibi. The ego says “Feelings are for losers and weaklings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most effective strategy for staying with emotion instead of offloading it is something I learned from a yoga teacher. And from a few members of the military Special Forces. It’s breathing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Breathing is also the key to another strategy for reckoning with emotion, and one of the most underrated leadership superpowers: practicing calm.</p>
<p>I define calm as creating perspective and mindfulness while managing emotional reactivity.</p>
<p>Calm is a superpower because it is the balm that heals one of the most prevalent workplace stressors: anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Rumble: conspiracies, confabulations, and shitty first drafts</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If the reckoning is how we walk into a tough story, the rumble is where we go to the mat with it and own it.</p>
<p>The rumble starts with this universal truth: In the absence of data, we will always make up stories. It’s how we are wired. Meaning making is in our biology, and when we’re in struggle, our default is often to come up with a story that makes sense of what’s happening and gives our brain information on how best to self-protect. And it happens a hundred times a day at work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In our SFDs, fear fills in the data gaps. What makes that scary is that stories based on limited real data and plentiful imagined data, blended into a coherent, emotionally satisfying version of reality, are called conspiracy theories. Yes, we are all conspiracy theorists with our own stories, constantly filling in data gaps with our fears and insecurities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Confabulation has a really great and subtle definition: A confabulation is a lie told honestly. To confabulate is to replace missing information with something false that we believe to be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Confabulation shows up at work when we share what we believe is factual information, but it’s really just our opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gottschall writes, “Conspiracy is not limited to the stupid, the ignorant, or the crazy. It is a reflex of the storytelling mind’s compulsive need for meaningful experience.” The problem is that rather than rumbling with vulnerability and staying in uncertainty, we start to fill in the blanks with our fears and worst-case-scenario planning. I love this line from Gottschall: “To the conspiratorial mind, shit never just happens.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The three most dangerous stories we make up are the narratives that diminish our lovability, divinity, and creativity.</p>
<p>The reality check around our lovability: Just because someone isn’t willing or able to love us, it doesn’t mean that we are unlovable.</p>
<p>The reality check around our divinity: No person is ordained to judge our divinity or to write the story of our spiritual worthiness.</p>
<p>The reality check around our creativity: Just because we didn’t measure up to some standard of achievement doesn’t mean that we don’t possess gifts and talents that only we can bring to the world. And just because someone failed to see the value in what we can create or achieve doesn’t change its worth or ours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we own a story and the emotion that fuels it, we get to simultaneously acknowledge that something was hard while taking control of how that hard thing is going to end. We change the narrative. When we deny a story and when we pretend we don’t make up stories, the story owns us. It drives our behavior, and it drives our cognition, and then it drives even more emotions until it completely owns us.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Revolution</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not afraid of the word revolution, I’m afraid of a world that’s becoming less courageous and authentic. I’ve always believed that in a world full of critics, cynics, and fearmongers, taking off the armor and rumbling with vulnerability, living into our values, braving trust with open hearts, and learning to rise so we can reclaim authorship of our own stories and lives is the revolution. Courage is rebellion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Revolution might sound a little dramatic, but in this world, choosing authenticity and worthiness is an absolute act of resistance. Choosing to live and love with our whole hearts is an act of defiance. You’re going to confuse, piss off, and terrify lots of people-including yourself. One minute you’ll pray that the transformation stops, and the next minute you’ll pray that it never ends. You’ll also wonder how you can feel so brave and so afraid at the same time. At least that’s how I feel most of the time … brave, afraid, and very, very alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Own the fear, find the cave, and write a new ending for yourself, for the people you’re meant to serve and support, and for your culture. Choose courage over comfort. Choose whole hearts over armor. And choose the great adventure of being brave and afraid. At the exact same time.</p>

<p>PayPal hired Mark Grether who was head of Uber’s ad business to lead the initiative of an ad network. </p>
<p>Costco’s membership fees declined from 86% to 50% of the its operating profit. It has shown economies of scale and benefits from a more favorable revenue mix.</p>
<p>Salesforce’s revenue grew 11% to $9.1B, missing Wall Street estimates by $20M. Current Remaining Performance Obligations - the best indicator of future growth - rose 10%, missing estimates of 12%. The slowing growth is partially due to broader macroeconomic challenges and internal execution issues. Salesforce Data Cloud is contributing to 25% of the deals valued above $1M, indicating it’s well-positioned to benefit from AI boom.</p>
<p>Live Nation has caused such widespread outrage in 2022 Taylor Swift Eras Tour ticket sales because fans faced technical glitches and exorbitant fees. Live Nation was accused of locking venues into exclusive deals and bullying artists into using its services, which caused higher ticket prices through service and convenience fees. Live Nation is under scrutiny by the government. It is forced to divest Ticketmaster (acquired in 2020). Fans &#x2F; artists are expecting increased competition in live music industry and lower prices, and a smoother ticket buying experience.</p>

<p>AI agents as the next frontier could make traveling personalized. The key metrics to define their success are 1) gross bookings, 2) nights booked, 3) average daily rate (ADR), 4) revenue per available room (RevPAR), customer acquisition cost (CAC). </p>
<p>The largest travel companies (online travel agencies and rentals and hotel chains) are Booking Holdings, Airbnb, Expedia, Marriott, and Hilton.</p>
<p>Highlights: 1) Booking Holdings (operating as an OTA): CEO Glenn Fogel envisions AI enhancing connected trips (single booking that include multiple travel elements such as flights, accommodations, car rentals, etc), 2) Airbnb exceeded expectations on both revenue and profitability in Q1 due to its robust international expansion, while slowing down the growth in North America. Airbnb is aiming to create an AI powered concierge to elevate the overall Airbnb experiences, 3) Expedia (operating as an OTA): Expedia is currently facing challenges of transition and adjustment: Vrbo vacation rental platform integration into Expedia platform is slower than expected. And it’s also facing challenges in attracting and retaining customers in its B2C segment. A new CEO Ariane Gorin was recently appointed to help navigate through these challenges. 4) Marriott (operating as booking platform): Marriott has developed Homes &amp; Villas tool that allows users to search for vacation rentals using language. A slow-down RevPAR in North America has been observed which indicates a shift in consumer preferences towards international destinations and alternative accommodations. Its brand reputation, loyalty program and focus on group&#x2F;business travel remain strong. 5) Hilton: has strong emphasis on personalization and loyalty programs though facing headwinds in the US. CEO Chris Nassetta envisions AI-powered tools to address guest concerns in real time.</p>

<p>This is a good summary of Nvidia’s strategies towards computing, path to AI domination, tailwinds of efficiency, position in the future.</p>
<p>Nvidia is “at the right place at the right time”: </p>
<ul>
<li>During 2000-2010 where the world successfully emerged from the dot-com bust, demand of Nvidia’s GPUs increased as the proliferation of games and multimedia applications. By 2011, Nvidia had already begun to reposition the company’s strategy for GPU chips towards mobile computing. At the same time, the concept of cloud computing, crypto-mining, and data center started to form.</li>
<li>Nvidia has built grounded relationship with academics and researchers. According to the paper published by Andrew Ng to show the power of NVIDIA GPU. During 2011-2015, Ng had been working as the Chief Scientist at many big tech firms and deployed data center architectures based on Nvidia’s GPUs. During 2010-2014, data center and HPC grew at a compounded growth rate of 64%. This period of time was one of the moments that set Nvidia on the course to dominate AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>In semiconductor industry, there are two different ways of manufacturing chips at scale:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designing and manufacturing your own chip - what Intel was doing. Manufacturing chips can be very expensive and hard. Today, chip foundries such as Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung are able to maintain leading edge.</li>
<li>Designing and producing powerful chips at a quicker pace by partnering with chip foundries like TSMC - what Nvidia and AMD fabless companies are doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024 could be the first year that Huang’s Nvidia could cede some market share to AMD. AMD launched their own MI300-series and Intel launched their Gaudi3 AI Accelerator chip, aiming to get back share from Nvidia’s H100&#x2F;H200 chips. However Huang looks ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Huang believes Nvidia must turn its attention to the next leg of AI - Model Inference. </p>
<p>Tech companies spend more on AI data center equipment over years, Nvidia’s revenue won’t slow down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nvidia’s executives also believe that company can benefit from demand from specific industry verticals, such as automotive.s</p>
<p>Tesla, for example, is leading self driving cars.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automotive AI and Sovereign AI are two future areas of growth where enterprises continue to spend on data centers for model training and inferencing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors also assessed Nvidia’s valuation and believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 2023 and 2026, Nvidia’s sales should be growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 43–45%.</li>
<li>Over the next 3 years, they expect operating profit to grow in line with revenue growth, with operating profit margins remaining relatively flat in 2025 and 2026.</li>
</ul>

<p>A good overview of Amazon’s in-house semiconductor designs (Nitro, Graviton, SSDs, Inferentia, and Trainium). It includes how Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Nvidia Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, Equinix Fabric, Coreweave, Cloudflare, and Lambda are each fighting Amazon’s dominance across multiple vectors and to various degrees.</p>
<p>Amazon’s custom silicon efforts - Nitro:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS worked with Cavium on developing the custom SoC on a discrete PCIe card and associated software, named “Nitro System”. It removes workloads from server CPU cores to the custom Nitro chips.</li>
<li>Annapurna Labs was acquired by Amazon in 2015. It focuses on server SOCs for networking and storage. Amazon was trying to continue its efforts on storage, and Nitro is the main enabler of a competitive advantage in these storage and databases.</li>
<li>Nitro provides services such as virtual disk to the tenant’s virtual machines and enables customers to dynamically grow and shrink high performance storage at low cost. </li>
<li>Amazon worked with Marvell to co-design the AWS Nitro SSD controller. The focus was on avoiding latency spikes and latency variability, and maximizing the lifetime of the SSD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other two clouds (Google and Microsoft) are years behind Amazon, both required a partner, and both were stuck with 1st or 2nd generation merchant silicon for the next few years. </p>
<p>James Hamilton, an engineer in Amazon, had and look at two key ways in which using AWS-designed, Arm-based CPUs could offer advantages compared to their external counterparts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using Arm’s scale in mobile by using the arm-designed Neoverse cores or </li>
<li>TSMC’s manufacturing scale. Both would reduce costs and offer better value to customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>In-house CPUs enables Amazon to design CPUs to maximize density and minimize server and system level energy which helps reduce costs. The tremendous scale of Amazon especially regarding general-purpose compute and storage-related verticals will continue to drive a durable advantage in the cloud for many years.</p>

<p><em>Ultrafusion is Apple’s marketing name for using a local silicon interconnect (bridge die) to connect the two M2 Max chips in a package. The two chips are exposed as a single chip to many layers of software. M2 Ultra utilizes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-1-pad-limited">TSMC’s InFO-LSI packaging technology</a>. This is a similar concept as TSMC’s CoWoS-L that is being adopted by Nvidia’s Blackwell and future accelerators down the road to make large chips. The only major difference between Apple and Nvidia’s approaches are that InFO is chip-first vs CoWoS-L is chip-last process flow, and that they are using different types of memory.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Apple’s purchases of GPUs are minuscule and Apple is not a top 10 customer of Nvidia. The production of M2 Ultras can be consistent with the fact that Apple is using their own silicon in their own data centers for serving AI to Apple users. And Apple has expansion plans for their own data center infrastructure. Furthermore, Apple made a number of hires including Sumit Gupta who joined to lead cloud infrastructure at Apple in March. </p>

<p>Starbucks had offered a gift card since 2001 and started to pair it with a new loyalty program “Starbucks Rewards” in 2008. Consumers are allowed to access free wifi and refillable coffee by paying with a reloadable card. The card was put onto an app in 2010 and expanded to over 9000 locations. It quickly became the largest combined mobile payments in loyalty program in the US. Uses load or reload around $10 B of value onto their cards each year and so about $1.9B of stored card value sat on the company’s balance sheet, just like customer deposits. There are several advantages: 1) the company does not pay interest on customer funds, and 2) sweep customer funds into company’s own bank account when it concludes customers may have forgotten about them - this is called ‘breakage’. In late 2023, Starbucks was accused of making it impossible for consumers to spend down their stored value cards by only allowing funds to be added in $5 increments and requiring a $10 minimum spend. Although the company has to pay rewards to customers, it saves on merchant discount fees and receives a lots of free and valuable personal information about customers.</p>

<p><em>I think the release highlights something important happening in Al right now: experimentation with four kinds of models - Al models, models of use, business models, and mental models of the future. What is worth paying attention to is how all the Al giants are trying many different approaches to see what works.</em></p>
<p><em>This demonstrates a pattern: the most advanced generalist Al models often outperform specialized models, even in the specific domains those specialized models were designed for.</em></p>
<p><em>That means that if you want a model that can do a lot - reason over massive amounts of text, help you generate ideas, write in a non-robotic way - you want to use one of the three frontier models: GPT-40, Gemini 1.5, or Claude 3 Opus.</em></p>
<p><em>The potential gains to AI, the productivity boosts and innovation, along with the weird risks, come from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/superhuman">larger, less constrained models</a>. And the benefits come from figuring out how to apply AI to your own use cases, even though that takes work. Frontier models thus have a very different approach to use cases than more constrained models. Take a look at this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfAYBdaGVxs">demo, from OpenAI, where GPT-4o (rather flirtatiously?) helps someone work through an interview,</a> and compare it to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Q_EYoV1kZWk?si=lspCJUSZed9se-QR">this demo of Apple’s AI-powered Siri</a>, helping with appointments. Radically different philosophies at work.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Al Models: Apple does not have frontier model like Google and Microsoft do, but they have created a bunch of small models that are able to run on Al-focused chips in their products. The medium-sized model that can be called by iPhone in the cloud. The model that’s running on iPhone and the model that’s running in the cloud are as good as Mistral’s and ChatGPT.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Models of Use: However, larger, less constrained models are the potential gains to Al, the productivity boosts and innovation. You would prefer to use GPT-4o to do nuanced tasks such as helping with your interviews rather than use Apple Al-powered Siri.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Business Models: Apple sounds like they will start with free service as well, but may decide to charge in the future. The truth is that everyone is exploring this space, and how they make money and cover costs is still unclear (though there is a lot of money out there. People don’t trust Al companies because they are concerning about privacy. However Apple makes sure models cannot learn about your data even if it wanted to. Personal data on your iPhone are only accessed by local Al.</p>
<p>And those handed to the cloud is encrypted. For those data given to OpenAl, it’s anonymous and requires explicit permission. Apple is making very ethical use of Al. Though we should still be cautious about Apple’s training data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Models of the Future: Apple and OpenAl have different goals. Apple is building narrow Al systems that can accurately answer questions about your personal data. While OpenAl is building autonomous agents that would complete complex tasks for you. In comparison, Apple has a clear and practical vision of how Al can be applied, while the future OpenAl’s AGI remains to be seen.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>These on-device models are decent (they’re built on top of open-source models) and outperform Google’s on-device model, Gemma-7B, 70% of the time.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>For more complex questions like “Find the photo I took at the beach last summer,” Siri will consult a smarter AI model that runs on Apple’s servers.</em></p>

<p>Three research findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Founder-led businesses outpaced other companies by a wide margin. (Researched by Ruediger Fahlenbrach in 2009).</li>
<li>Family-owned businesses ignored short-term quarterly numbers to focus on the long-term value creation, which lead to a major outperformance because of 1) lower risk-taking in the short term, and 2) greater vision and investment for the long term. (Researched by Henry McVey in 2005).</li>
<li>Businesses managed by billionaires outperformed the market by 7% annually from 1996 to 2011. (researched by Joel Shulman in 2012).</li>
</ol>
<p>Insights behind the findings above:</p>
<ol>
<li>Founders and owners often have their life savings invested in the shares of the business, so they have the incentive aligned.</li>
<li>Bureaucracy reduces business performance. They will almost never make a radical shift, because politicians care more about their job title than the long term prospects of the business. Founders on the other hand are able to make radical decisions and overrule the bureaucracy, therefore they can take the business in a direction to fulfill long term vision. </li>
<li>Founders and billionaires are exceptional people to run business.</li>

<p><em>I have noticed the proliferation of a different type of species in academia: what I call The Failed Corporatist. This is someone who stumbles upon academia not so much out of a love for The Truth, as due to an inability to thrive in corporate settings for various other, unrelated reasons. But the Failed Corporatist has a very conventional, corporate like mindset anyway. It usually loves process, admin and adding more admin and adding more process and METRICS and social conformity. This skill set enables them to ascend the ranks of academic administration, often gaining significant influence and control over The Weird Nerd. Confronted with this altered habitat, The Nerd often finds itself in a state of distress and confusion. Its intrinsic motivation clashes with the newly imposed corporate-like order and the demand for conformity, leading to frantic efforts to assert its natural tendencies. Unfortunately, these efforts are often met with resistance or outright rejection, not only from The Failed Corporatist but also from the broader world that the academic reserve is a part of. All in all, I think this disturbance means the remaining Nerds are further driven away.</em></p>

<p><em>A couple of months ago I wrote a piece called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-flight-of-the-weird-nerd-from">“The flight of the Weird Nerd from academia”</a>, in which I argued there is a trend wherein Weird Nerds are being driven out of academia by the so-called Failed Corporatist phenotype. Katalin Karikó is a perfect example of a Weird Nerd. I recently argued that many Weird Nerds (I called them autistics, but people really hated that<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-weird-nerd-comes-with-trade-offs?utm_source=/inbox/saved&utm_medium=reader2#footnote-2-144974567">2</a>), have <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/autism-and-the-internet-will-defeat">found a refuge on the Internet</a>, where their strengths are amplified and their weaknesses are less important.</em> </p>
<p><em>And I believe the conversation here starts with accepting a simple truth, which is that Weird Nerds will have certain traits that might be less than ideal, that these traits come “in a package” with other, very good traits, and if one makes filtering or promotion based on the absence of those traits a priority, they will miss out on the positives. It means really internalizing the existence of trade-offs in human personality, in an era where accepting trade-offs is deeply unfashionable, and structuring institutions and their cultures while keeping them in mind.</em></p>
<p><em>Everything comes at a cost: spend more time worrying about politics, there will be less time for science. What’s more, the kind of people who really care about science or truth to the extent that Karikó did, are not the same people that get motivated by playing politics or being incredibly pleasant. There is a strong anti-correlation between these interests (that of course does not mean there is no one who is good at both.) Selecting future intellectuals based on traits like Agreeableness or Extraversion might not be only unnecessary, but actually harmful. We might be actively depleting the talent pool of the kind of people we do want to see in academic institutions.</em></p>

<p><strong>Broadcom: AI Surge - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/broadcom-ai-surge">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Broadcom operates across two primary segments: 1) semiconductor solutions, which has traditionally been Broadcom’s core strength, and 2) infrastructure software, which was propelled since acquisition of VMware in 2023 Nov. </p>
<p>Highlights: 1) $3.1B (roughly 26% of all) in revenue is from AI products. AI alone contributed to a $2.2B revenue increase year over year. 2) Margins were down year over year significantly, primarily due to expenses related to VMware integration. 3) Broadcom has a gigantic net debt position of $62B. 4) strong cash generation - $18 B in past 12 months. 5) 10-for-1 stock split will happen in July 15. 6) it’s known for regular cadence of product introduction - Tomahawk and Jericho switching products.</p>

<p><em>AI is both a threat and an opportunity for software leaders. But for cybersecurity giants, AI means business. New technology means new threats, with Large Language Models (LLMs) dealing with vast amounts of data in the cloud and on devices.</em></p>
<p><strong>― Cybersecurity Earnings - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/cybersecurity-earnings">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AI tech stack has 3 layers: 1) top: Apps or enterprise software, 2) middle: LLMs, 3) bottom: compute hardware and chips. The bottom layer (NVIDIA, AMD, ASML, TSMC) and middle layer (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) have already benefitted from AI revenue boost. However it usually takes longer time to manifest because companies take time to adapt to new ways of optimizing processes, particularly in ERP, CRM, and BI verticals.</p>
<p>There is sentiment around enterprise software saying that AI would make the cost of software go to zero. But there are also some counterarguments: 1) the main expense for most software companies is not R&amp;D but sales and marketing, 2) switching cost is high enough that even freemium software is not able to disrupting existing solutions, 3) resources needed to develop new features will decline, 4) implementing and maintaining a software solution is costly.</p>
<p>This article shows how some of the cybersecurity companies are navigating current environment.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Palo Alto Networks</p>
<p>Strong strength and rapid growth in Next-Gen Security (NGS) offerings. Its platformization focus and one-stop shop for security needs include cloud-delivered security services like Prisma Access (SASE), Prisma Cloud (cloud security), and Cortex (security operations). It’s facing billing issues: it’s slashing its FY24 billings guidance by $600M.</p>
</li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike</p>
<p>Strong Q1 performance, lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to  lightweight agent and unified approach, $4B in ARR growing at over 30% YoY.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fortinet</p>
<p>It specializes in network security appliances, secure SD-WAN, and operational tech security. It’s hardware-centric. And it’s currently under competitive pressure.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Zscaler</p>
<p>It specializes in Zero Trust solutions, a security model that assumes no user or device should be trusted by default. It has strong growth and optimistic outlook. It’s riding the wave of increasing cybersecurity demand. And it current has a rumor of Broadcom acquisition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloudflare</p>
<p>Descipte beating earnings estimates in Q1 FY24, stock price has dropped due to concerns about its conservative guidance. Although there is short term headwind, long term growth is still promising.</p>

<p>It remains questions whether AI could become commoditized, whether it has potential to produce revenue and profits, and whether a new economy is actually being born.</p>
<p>According to Anshu Sharma, the future of AI startups (OpenAI and Anthropic) could be dim, and big tech companies (Microsoft and Google) will make profits from existing users and networks but need to spend a lot of money for a long time, which would leave the AI startups unable to compete. This is true that AI startups are already struggling right now, because at current stage AI is hard to commoditized, and it requires a lot of investments.</p>
<p>The improvement of AI is slowing down because they exhausted all available data on the internet. Regarding the adoption of AI in enterprise, time is required to make sure that chatbots can replace the specialized knowledge of human experts due to technical challenges.</p>

<p><em>One thing we’ve learned: the business goal must be paramount. In our work with clients, we ask them to identify their most promising business opportunities and strategies and then work backward to potential gen AI applications. Leaders must avoid the trap of pursuing tech for tech’s sake. The greatest rewards also will go to those who are not afraid to think big. As we’ve observed, the leading companies are the ones that are focusing on reimagining entire workflows with gen AI and analytical AI rather than simply seeking to embed these tools into their current ways of working.  For that to be effective, leaders must be ready to manage change at every step along the way. And they should expect that change to be constant: enterprises will need to design a gen AI stack that is robust, cost-efficient, and scalable for years to come. They’ll also need to draw on leaders from throughout the organization. Realizing profit-and-loss impact from gen AI requires close partnership with HR, finance, legal, and risk to constantly readjust the resourcing strategies and productivity expectations. - Alex Singla</em></p>
<p><em>Although it varies by industry, roughly half of our survey respondents say they are using readily available, off-the-shelf gen AI models rather than custom-designed solutions. This is a very natural tendency in the early days of a new technology—but it’s not a sound approach as gen AI becomes more widely adopted. If you have it, your competitor probably has it as well. Organizations need to ask themselves: What is our moat? The answer, in many cases, likely will be customization. - Alexander Sukharevsky</em> </p>

<p>Industries are struggling with budgeting for Gen AI. There are some areas where investments are paying off, such as meaningful cost reductions in HR and revenue increases in supply chain management from Gen AI.</p>
<p>There are varies risks of Gen AI usage: data privacy, bias, intellectual property (IP) infringement, model management risks, security and incorrect use, etc. Among all, inaccuracy and intellectual property infringement ar eincreasingly considered relevant risks to organizations’ Gen AI use.</p>
<p>According to the three archetypes for implementing Gen AI solutions (takers, shapers, and makers), survey has found that in most industries, organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs, about half of reported Gen AI uses publicly available models or tools with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.</p>
<p>The time required to put Gen AI to production for most of the respondents is around 1-4 months.</p>
<p>Gen AI high performers are excelling. Some common characteristics or practices: 1) They are using Gen AI in more business functions (an average of 3) compared to others average 2,  2) They are more likely to use Gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development like others, but they are more likely than other s to use Gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management, 3) They are three times as likely as others to be using Gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting doc and risk assessment to R&amp;D testing and pricing and promotions, 4) They are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized version to develop their own proprietary foundation models, 5) encountered challenges with their operating model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The analogy here is to Search, another service that requires astronomical investments in both technology and infrastructure; Apple has never built and will never need to build a competitive search engine, because it owns the devices on which search happens, and thus can charge Google for the privilege of making the best search engine the default on Apple devices. This is the advantage of owning the device layer, and it is such an advantageous position that Apple can derive billions of dollars of profit at essentially zero cost.</em></p>
<p><em>First, with regards to the title of this Article, the fact it is possible to be too early with AI features, as Microsoft seemed to be in this case, implies that not having AI features does not mean you are too late. Yes, AI features could differentiate an existing platform, but they could also diminish it. Second, Apple’s orientation towards prioritizing users over developers aligns nicely with its brand promise of privacy and security: Apple would prefer to deliver new features in an integrated fashion as a matter of course; making AI not just compelling but societally acceptable may require exactly that, which means that Apple is arriving on the AI scene just in time.</em></p>

<p><em>In an H100 GPU, every second we can move at most 3.35 terabytes of RAM in and out of memory registers. And in the same second, we can multiply 1.98 quadrillion 8bit floating point numbers. This means that it can do 591 floating point operations in the time it takes to move one byte. In the industry this is known as a 591:1 ops:byte ratio. In other words, if you are going to spend time moving an entire gigabyte around you should do at least 591 billion floating point operations. If you don’t, you are just wasting GPU and potential compute. But if you do more than that, you are just waiting around on memory bandwidth to get your data in there. In our models, the amount of memory we need to move around is relatively fixed, it’s roughly the size of our model. This means that we do have some control over on how much math that we can do by changing our batch size.</em> </p>
<p><em>In reality, we’ve discovered that bottleneck can arise from everywhere from memory bandwidth, network bandwidth between GPUs, between nodes, and other areas. Furthermore the location of those bottlenecks will change dramatically on the model size, architecture, and usage patterns.</em></p>

<p>This is a behind the scenes look at how OpenAI scaled ChatGPT and the OpenAI APIs. But also a very good talk to show how hard it is to scale infrastructure for model architecture etc, and how important it is to master these skills and knowledge in chip manufacture and design industry and in LLM development industry. The talk covers 1) GPU RAM and KV Cache, 2) batch size and ops:bytes, 3) scheduling in dozens of clusters, 4) autoscaling (and the lack thereof). </p>
<p>Key facts to consider when developing metrics for compute optimization and model scaling:</p>
<ol>
<li>GPU memory is valuable. But it is frequently a bottleneck, not necessarily compute.</li>
<li>Cache misses are non linear on compute, because we suddenly need to start recomputing all stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>When scaling ChatGPT, we need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at KV cache utilization and maximize all the GPU RAM we have, and </li>
<li>Monitor batch size - the number of concurrent requests we run to the GPU at the same time, to ensure the GPUs are fully saturated. These are two main metrics used to determine how loaded our servers were.</li>
</ol>
<p>In reality, there are more bottlenecks (memory bandwidth, network bandwidth between GPUs, between nodes, and other areas) and the location where they arise can change according to the model size, architecture, and usage patterns. The variability has made it very hard for AI model developer and chip manufactures to design chips to get that balance right. Future ML architectures and sizes have been very difficult to predict. But overall we need to be tweaking this math as the models evolve. </p>
<p>The third challenge is to find enough GPUs. Note that the time of a response is dominated by the GPU streaming out one token at a time, as a result, it’s been more important to just get capacity and optimized a well balanced fleet, over putting things geographically close to users.</p>
<p>The fourth challenge is the inability to scale up this fleet. OpenAI has delayed some feature of ChatGPT due to the limitation of compute resources.</p>
<p>Some lessons they have learned in solving GPU challenges: </p>
<ol>
<li>It’s important to treat this as a system engineering challenge as opposed to a pure research project. </li>
<li>It’s important to adaptively factor in the novel constraints of these systems. </li>
<li>Every time model architecture shifts, a new inference idea is proposed or a product decision is changed, we need to adapt and rerun a lot of this math again. Diving really deep has been important. This low level of implementation details matter.</li>
</ol>
<p>The final challenge is abuse on the system and AI safety challenges.</p>

<p><em>For many years, particularly following the original SARS pandemic, there was a lot of conversations around how do we get in front of the next pandemic, how do we figure out what’s coming and how do we prepare for it. And there was a lot of research that was launched to try and resolve that key question. It’s like does the effort to try and stop the problem cause the problem. I think that from my point of view there is a very high probability that there was some leak that meant that the work that was going on to try and get in front of the next pandemic and understand what we could do to prepare ourselves, and what vaccines could be developed and so on, actually led to the pandemic. So then when that happens how do you respond when you are sitting in that seat, that’s the key question that I think this committee is uncovering. - David Friedberg</em></p>

And I think that that is a statement that frankly reeks of being cocooned in an elite bubble for way too long. Let me just explain. If you look at where Trump’s support is strongest. It’s really in Middle America and sort of the heartland of America, basically the part of America that the Coastal at least dismissively refer to as flyover country. It’s a lot of the industrial midwest and frankly that part of the country had not had the same type of economic experience that we’ve had in Silicon Valley. They have not been beneficiaries of globalization. If you are in a handful of export industries in America and I’m talking about if you are in Hollywood or you are in Big Finance or you are in Software, then globalization has been great for you, because it has created huge global markets for our products. However, if you are in an industry that has to compete with global exports, then it’s been very bad with you and blue collar workers have been hurt, labor’s been hurt, people who work with their hands have been hurt. They have not benefitted in the same way from the system we’ve had in this country for the last 30 years. So you can understand why they would not be so enchanted with elite thinking. I think to then label those people as lacking in caring or empathy or not being good parents because they haven’t had the same economic ride that you had for the last 30 years and then you are the one who is fighting a legal battle to kick some of those people off the public beach in front of your beach house, and then you are saying they are the ones lacking in empathy, dude, look in the mirror. - David Sacks</em></p>

<p><em>Apple took a shortcut to get here, they partnered with open ai. And this is something that I don’t think they’ve ever really done before at the operating system level. Apple is famous for being vertically integrated, for being a walled garden, for being end to end. They control everything from the chips to the hardware to the operating system, and they don’t let anybody else in, until you are at the App Store Layer. This is allowing somebody in beneath the level of the App Store. This is allowing someone OpenAI to get access to your data, and to control your apps, at the operating system level. Elon pointed out wait a sec what are the privacy implications here. And I think there are major privacy implications. There is simply no way that you are going to allow an AI on your phone to take. Remember Apple in the past has been the advocate for consumer privacy. There is a whole issue of the San Bernardino terrorist where the FBI went to Apple and said we want you to give us back door access to their phone and Apple refused to do it and went to court to defend user privacy. And furthermore, one of Apple’s defenses to the antitrust arguments for allowing sideloading and allowing other apps to get access to parts of the operating system, they’ve always said we can’t do this because it would jeopardize user privacy and user security. Well here they are opening themselves up to OpenAI in a very deep and fundamental way in order to accelerate the development of these features… I think this is going to open Pandora’s box for Apple, because again they’ve proven that they can open up the operating system to a third party now, and who knows what the privacy implications of this are going to be. - David Sacks</em></p>
<p><em>I think there are three numbers that matter: the inflation rate, the growth in GDP, and the cost to borrow. The growth in GDP in the first quarter of 2024 was a lousy - 1.3% on the annualized basis. And even if the rate of inflation came down, we are still inflating the cost of  everything by north of 3%. So the economy is only growing by 1.3% and it costs more than 3% each year to buy stuff. So that means everyone’s spending power is reducing, and our government’s ability to tax is declining, because the economy is only growing by 1.3%. And the most important fact is that the interest rates are still between 4-5% (4.7%). That means that borrowing money costs 4.7%, but the business the economy on average is only growing 1.3%. So just think about that for a second. We have tremendous amount of leverage on businesses on economy on the federal government. That leverage, the cost to pay for that debt is more than 4-5% but you are only growing your revenue by 1.3%. So at some point you cannot make your payments. That is true for consumers, it’s true for enterprises, and it’s true for federal government. The whole purpose of raising rates is to slow the flow of money through the economy. And by slowing the flow of money through the economy, there is less spending which means that you are reducing the demand relative to the supplies, so the cost of things should come down, you should reduce the rate of increasing in the cost of things… There is certainly a shift in the market because what this tells us is that the timeline at which the fed will cut rates is coming is a little bit. So the market is saying okay let’s adjust to lower rates, the 10 year treasury yield has come down a little bit, but we are still in a difficult situation for people, and for businesses. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>If the revenue of everything combined which is GDP isn’t going faster than the increase in the cost of everything, people, businesses, and government can’t afford their stuff. And that’f fundamentally what is going on right now. What we need to see is a normalization where GDP growth is greater than inflation rate. And as soon as that happens then we have a more normalized and stable economy. So right now things are not stable. There is a lot of difficulty and strain in the system. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>You had 1.3% GDP growth rate with a 6% of GDP deficit by the government. If the government wasn’t printing so much money, wasn’t over spending, and you were to have a balanced budget, it would be a recession. It would be negative GDP growth if not for the government’s program stimulating the economy. And a lot of jobs you are talking about are government jobs. The government is creating jobs like crazy, not in the private sector but in the public sector, because it is an election year. So there is a lot of political forces proping things up, and I wonder what happens after the election. - David Sacks</em> </p>

<p><em>What I learned from all of that, if I look at his mistakes and successes, I learned a couple things. The first is most of the money he’s made by holding onto things, not the momentum trading that he was known for in, in public equities. And number two, he made most of his money buying quality, like quality was very important to his success. And that’s something I’ve taken from him. And I truly believe, like <u>the environment in which you grow up dictates the kind of person and mentality you will have in life</u>. So let me just quickly expand on that. If you grow up during the Great Depression, I would presume you’re focused on saving every penny and looking for cheap. And I think I’m just taking a guess that you’re gonna be much more focused on buying cigar butts in life than you might be on buying the highest quality asset you can find and maybe paying up for. Somehow my father figured out that the <u>real money is in the best businesses and the higher quality assets</u>. And he instilled that in me very early. And sometimes these things look expensive. And so my point earlier is that he taught me very early <u>not to dismiss something that might look expensive on the surface before you do the deep work and really understand what you’re buying and what it’s worth</u>.</em> </p>
<p><em>And the problem that a lot of value investors have, I think, is that they all screen for low p ratios, high dividend yields, you know, low ev to cash flows, what whatever it is. They’re screening and they will miss because the kind of any value in that area is gonna get competed away. And so I’m more interested in businesses that might look expensive on the surface, but actually aren’t, and you have to be careful because a lot actually are expensive, right? And there’s no margin safety there. But there is Peter Kaufman said <u>there’s margin where there’s mystery</u>. I think that’s so true. There’s margin where there’s mystery. And so sometimes <u>the best investments are those that are misunderstood and might appear expensive, and they’re often quality kinds of businesses</u>. So I gravitate toward quality partly as a result of that influence he had on me, if that makes sense.</em> </p>
<p><em>Tesla company is definitely one of the most misunderstood companies that I’ve seen in my 25 years or so of managing money for others. It’s such an interesting company and it, and it’s so misunderstood and I think it’s misunderstood for a few reasons. One, you have this kind of overarching personality where people start to formulate opinions based on what Elon is. And people think about it as a car company. And third, most people haven’t actually dived in, right? They’ve not spent the hundreds and hundreds of hours on this company and they haven’t really gone through the financials to understand the economics of the business. So there are a few things coming together where I think that this company still remains misunderstood, but there’s a reason why it’s up whatever 15000% or so since the IPO. And there is a reason why it continues to go higher over time because there are plenty of people that do get it right and that it’s just getting more and more concentrated into what I would probably call hands of smart money.</em></p>
<p><em>I’d say it’s not just a car company, <u>it is very much an EV company, but it’s not just a car company</u>… Why would the future look any different? And of course it, it it did. Why were people skeptical? While there were no paved roads, supply chains were very limited. There were very few fueling stations, there was very little manufacturing capacity. Kind of sound familiar right to today in EV terms. But ice vehicles, Henry Ford disrupted the horse and carriage very quickly within 20 years, which is happened to be pretty much the timeframe during which curves take formation is a 20 year disruption period with respect to pretty much all these transformational technologies.</em> </p>
<p><em>Going back to the guttenberg printing press and the steam engine and the spinning wheel, it’s all about 20 years. So my point is that there’s all of this skepticism and you had horse and carriage competing against this noisy ice vehicle. Both were forms of transportation, both gotten you from point A to point B, but one was fundamentally different. It was fundamentally different because it was a much more efficient process of getting you from point A to point B. And that is the lens from a kind of very high top down level that I look at Tesla and electric vehicles in general, <u>they’re just a much more efficient way to get you from point A to point B than ice vehicles. And what I mean by that is the cost of ownership and cost per mile is just much lower</u>. And so then it’s a question of what are the risks? What are the competitive advantage does Tesla have over the rest of the competition in EV and how will Tesla survive and thrive against ice vehicles? Which to me are going the way of the dinosaur. That is a big assumption that I believe is true because I think that <u>EV adoption is following the traditional S curve adoption phase</u> and there’s not a lot of time left for ice vehicles to exist.</em> </p>
<p><em>The real voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.</em> </p>
<p><em>I gave you the first kind of like lens at which I’m looking at Tesla as competing as an EV company against ice vehicles and ev as a whole being much more efficient than ice. But the other lens I should share is that I don’t think you can understand this company if you don’t understand. I could be totally wrong, but as assuming that I’m right, I don’t believe you can understand the company if you don’t understand that - to me it’s an advanced electronics manufacturer and software company competing against a traditional automobile manufacturing company.</em> </p>
<p><em><u>This is super important. It’s an electronics slash software company competing against traditional auto.</u> It’s super important to understand that because there’s certain things that kind of like come into play. There was an aeronautical engineer by the name of Theodore Wright, he devised this concept called the rights law, which states that for every doubling of cumulative production, that costs fall by a constant percentage. And when you understand that Tesla is an electronic software company, you understand like where is this company along this rights law curve.</em> </p>
<p><em>Tesla is so much further along the curve than any of the ice vehicles that are constrained because they’re not electronic in software companies, they’re traditional auto companies. And it’s Tesla’s so much further along the curve with respect to other EV companies. And so as ice vehicles traditional auto catches up, Tesla just moves much further along the curve. And so <u>the spread between the competitive advantage of Tesla, the other EV companies and traditional auto is actually widening</u>. It’s not getting more narrow, it’s widening because of its massive scale, which allows it to push itself out along the, the cost curve further than anybody else.</em> </p>
<p><em>We actually did buy more around current prices and these arguments, most of them at least except for the 50 billion compensation package, most of these arguments sound like the same arguments that you could go back and read since the company went public. They’re probably less negative articles today than there were around 2011, 2012, 2013. But they seem very similar. And yet the stock continues to go higher up 15,000 or so percent since it’s IPO. And what’s the case with pretty much every growth company from Amazon to Microsoft? <u>Any great growth company, there are always periods when the stock is not going up</u>. There have been so many massive drawdowns in Tesla since it’s IPO, like there’s gotta be a couple dozen, at least 40% drawdowns since it’s IPO or at least 30% drawdowns. And that’s just part of investing in growth companies. No businesses. And I wrote a paper called Power and Challenges of Compounding, which is on our website, but <u>growth companies just don’t go in straight lines. They move more like in a step formation</u>. And if you look at the kind of longer term chart of Tesla, Tesla’s just kind of in a step formation just like Amazon was and Microsoft was.</em> </p>
<p><em>I totally focus on the business fundamentals. I really don’t, I don’t let the stock prices dictate like what I’m thinking about the business. And when I’m looking at a business, a potential company to buy, I try my very best like not to pay any attention to the stock price and just come up with my own idea of what I think the business is worth. And so <u>the key is really to focus on the fundamentals. And if the fundamentals are moving in the right direction, then the stock price will take care of itself over time.</u> The the problem is that if you have all your money in one or even five companies or maybe even 10 companies, it’s really, really hard to deal with that emotionally.</em> </p>
<p><em>Mr. Rogers was not just a TV host who was the central figure for Mr. Rogers neighborhood, but he was also a Presbyterian minister. And I think that that upbringing education and that way of life influenced how he dealt with people. And he had this wonderful expression. He said that <u>there are three ways to ultimate success. The first is to be kind, the second is to be kind, and the third is to be kind</u>. I thought that was really interesting and very powerful and it meshed with how I wanted to try to live life. And it also me meshes with, you know, this idea of reciprocity, which is deep rooted human condition, right? <u>If we give kindness to the world and bringing kindness back, I truly believe that</u>. And, and so he was, and has been influential to how I think about life and how I try my best. I don’t always succeed, but I do try my best to live my life according to Mr. Rogers’ values.</em>  </p>
<p><em>Peter said that, look, you need to look at your life as one ladder. And there’s seven steps to the ladder. <u>These seven steps are pretty much in this order. Health and then family and friends, career, community, spirituality and hobbies.</u> The most important, those of those seven steps is health. Because health is multiplicative, right? If you take health and you multiply it by zero, everything else goes to zero, not good. So you wanna focus on that as first and foremost.</em>  </p>

<p>In this episode Christopher talked about his family history, investment in Tesla, Microsoft, Visa, and Mastercard, and some other personal development and investment tips. This is what I’ve learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>It completely changed my mind in understanding Tesla. I thought Tesla’s main business is traditional automobile, while EV is a new leading branch in the frontier. But it turns out that it’s wrong. Tesla is actually an electronic software company with a smart undercover of traditional automobile. As traditional auto vehicle companies catching up, Tesla is just moving further and further. Also being aware of what’s happening around Tesla: stock price was falling, sales growth is slowing, BMW and BYD are flooding the market with EV, unfocused CEO Elon Musk, no new models of the car since 2020, etc, I was already starting questioning Tesla, but in fact, the truth is Elon beat almost every milestone, he kept almost every promise, and he deserves his $50B pay package. What Tesla is current going through is as normal as what any other growth companies have experienced.</li>
<li>The key of being a value investor and picking valuable stocks is to focus on the business fundamentals but not stock price.</li>
<li>Diversifying portfolio is a good way to deal with pain and emotions, and stop you from interrupting the compounding process.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Experts, researchers and open source contributors — from Databricks and across the data and AI community gathered in San Francisco June 10 - 13, 2024 to discuss the latest technologies in data management, data warehousing, data governance, generative AI for the enterprise, and data in the era of AI. </p>
<p><u>Notes of “Ali Ghodsi, Co-founder and CEO,Databricks”:</u></p>
<p>There are three problem from AI practitioners: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Everyone wants AI </p>
<p>Organization don’t care about MMLU performance, they care about using model to do well on their data for their use cases and businesses. According to a survey, 85% of the use cases have not made it into production. This indicates that getting AI on your data into production is hard - people want high quality, low cost, and privacy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Security and privacy are under pressure</p>
<p>It’s under intense pressure. People care about AI regulation, data privacy, and cyberattacks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data estate is fragmented. </p>
<p>Lots of complexity, huge costs, and proprietary lock-in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Databricks solution to these three problems is data intelligence platform. The idea is: don’t give your data to vendors, instead, own your own data, store them in data lake in a format that’s standard. These are what Databricks is doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>They acquired Tabular because they want the data to be stored in a standard format so that every engine can access to.</li>
<li>They also launched project UniForm, which aims to make sure that UniForm has 100% full compatibility and interoperability for both of Delta Lake and Iceberg projects.</li>
<li>Unity Catalog allows you to do governance to ensure access, control, and security, and also discovery, lineage, auditing, data and model quality monitoring. And They have just open-sourced Unity Catalog.</li>
<li>Data in data lake combining with Mosaic AI’s AI models is called Data Intelligence Platform. This platform trains Gen AI models on your data in isolation for each customer, and leverages that throughout the platform for everything it does. </li>
<li>Data Intelligence is democratized data plus democratized AI. Democratized data means everyone in your organization should be able to access to the data directly. They, including those don’t know how to speak sql, should be able to access to data or get insights from data by spending languages. Democratized AI means everyone should be able to create AI models that understand your data in your organization.</li>
<li>All the Databricks now are available in 100% serverless.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Note of “Brian Ames, General Motors”:</u> </p>
<p>Their mission is zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. In order for GM to be part of the future, they need to become a software company. They started from building data silos, on-prem infrastructure, and keeping pace of innovation. Their vision and strategy are to change the culture, move to the cloud, create a data insights factory cloud, and build upon Databricks.</p>
<p>The GMs data insights factory today includes single source of truth (where big data are ingested), trusted data (with functions of GenAI platform, ETL and orchestration, and data warehousing), open ecosystem (with Meta’s LLMs, AI models, and data governance ), and react front end. Majority of the factory is supported by Databricks.</p>

<p>Good discussion about Tesla V12, FSD in China, and RoboTaxi. I learnt new views about end-to-end technology, Musk’s vision, overview of EV market, EV competitors, etc. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It makes so much sense for them so I think they should do it as quickly as possible. We are in the first inning of what should probably be an enormous tectonic shift in technology. And I think if whoever wins in the first inning usually isn’t the one that’s winning by the ninth inning. And so I would encourage anybody that’s winning right now to monetize, get secondaries, take money off the table as fast as possible. Because the future is unknown and the more disruptive the technology is, the more entropy there is, which means that there is going to be more changes not less. And again I would just look at search as an example, I would look at social networking as an example. When you look 20 years later the people who captured all the value were not the one that at the beginning who everybody thought was going to win. And so I think If it plays out similarly, it’s important for the people that are in the lead today, to recognize that it’s too early, and they should monetize their perceived success as quickly as they can to the largest magnitude as possible. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>I think OpenAI is running a very strategic game plan to become part of the tech establishment as quickly as they can, so that they are in the inside looking out as opposed to the outside looking in. They were able to add the former head of the NSA to their board of directors. It’s how you become part of the establishment. Do you think the former head of the NSA no long has a security clearance or knows people in the NSA? No of course not.  And I think that there is a group of people that want to make sure that these kinds of technologies and capabilities are firmly within the hands of the US apparatus and not anybody else. And so I think that that pulls them closer to the kinds of folks that could otherwise give them a hard time or regulate them, etc. So now what happens is when you have senate hearing about this stuff it’s more likely that it’s confidential behind closed door, it’s under the purview of National Security. All these things are beneficial to OpenAI. And secondly they were able to get Elon to drop his lawsuit. So the next logical step is now to create Capital Market distribution, which is really about syndicating ownership of the company to all the big deep pools of money, so that they are also rowing in the same direction in support of OpenAI. That’s what a lot of people don’t get, it’s not about valuations or this and that, this is about creating a highlevel game theory of how to create an international apparatus that supports your corporate objectives. There are a few companies that have done this well, and they are now one of them, the only thing left is to get shares into the hands of the BlackRocks, the t-rows, all the big mutual fund apparatuses of the world that then syndicate to all the individual investors of the world. You have everything, you have government connections, you have no real legal overhang, then the likelihood that an IRS agent all of a sudden decides to audit OpenAI is basically zero. It’s a smart business strategy. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>

<p>Good analysis of the direction of open LLM development in 2023 and 2024. In 2023, models were progressing in MMLU by leveraging more compute budgets to handle scaled active parameters and training tokens. In 2024, the progressing direction is slightly changed to be orthogonal to previous - which is improving on MMLU while keeping compute budgets constant.</p>

<p><em>The companies that have users interacting with their models consistently have moats through data and habits. The models themselves are not a moat, as I discussed at the end of last year when I tried to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/ml-moats">predict machine learning moats</a>, but there are things in the modern large language model (LLM) space that open-source will really struggle to replicate. Concretely, that difference is access to quality and diverse training prompts for fine-tuning. While I want open-source to win out for personal philosophical and financial factors, this obviously is not a walk in the park for the open-source community. It’ll be a siege of a castle with, you guessed it, a moat. We’ll see if the moat holds.</em></p>

<p><em>The goal of promoting scientific understanding for the betterment of society has a long history.

If we want LLMs to benefit everyone, my argument is that we need far more than just computer scientists and big-tech-approved social scientists working on these models. We need to continue to promote openness to support this basic feedback loop that has helped society flourish over the last few centuries.</em></p>
<p><em>The word openness has replaced the phrase open-source among most leaders in the open AI movement. It’s the easiest way to get across what your goals are, but it is not better in indicating how you’re actually supporting the open ecosystem.

<p>The report of Google Search’s death is exaggerated so far. In fact, search advertising has grown faster at Google than at Microsoft. User searching behavior is harder to change than people expected. Also, Google is leading the development of AI powered tools for Search: 1) “circle to search” is feature allowing a search from an image, text, or video without switching apps. 2) “Point your camera, ask a question” is a feature allowing for multisearch with both images and text for complex questions given an image to the tool. Overall, SGE (Search Generative Experience) is revolutionizing search experience (“10 blue links”) by  introducing a dynamic AI-enhanced experience.

<p>When we talk about investment, we talk about economic values. Current situation of AI is very similar to Cisco’s in 2000. Cisco as an internet company spread the capacity of the World Wide Web, but sooner people realized that there is no economic value in internet company, instead, opportunities are in e-commerce etc. AI is a tool very similar to web tech. Currently, with heightened expectations, people are allocating investments and capital expenditure in AI model development, however, end-user demand is unclear and revenue is relatively minimal. This situation makes AI look like a bubble from a very long term perspective.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a very insightful letter about how economic and tech trends of 2023 have shaped their thinking and investment portfolio. What I have learned from this letter: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tech industry has shifted their focus from unsustainable “growth at any cost” to more prudent forms of capital allocation. This results in laying off employees and slashing projects that are not relevant to the core business.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rising of interest rate is one of the reasons of bank crisis. During zero interest rate decade, banks sought higher rates of return by purchasing longer duration assets while the value of them are negatively correlated to interest rate. As those caused losses are known by the public, a liquidity crisis ensued.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The advancement of Gen AI has lowered the barriers of starting a software company, and lowered capital requirement in Bio Tech and material sciences, and changed the process of building companies fundamentally, and empowered new entrants to challenge established businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The key question is: where will value creation and capture take place? when and where should capital be allocated and company should be started? Some author’s opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s premature to declare winners now. Instead, author suggested people should deeply understand the underlying mechanisms that will be responsible for value creation over next few years.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are at least two areas of value creation now</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Proprietary data</p>
<p>Example: recent partnership between Reddit and Google</p>
</li>
<li><p>Infrastructure used to run AI application</p>
<p>For apps built on top of language models, responsiveness is a critical lynchpin. However GPUs are not well-suited to run inference.</p>
<p>Example: Author’s investment in Groq’s LPU for inference</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Heightened geopolitical tensions due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel and Hamas, escalating tensions between China and Taiwan, resulted in a de-globalization trend and also a strategic shift in the US. US legislative initiatives aims to fuel a domestic industrial renaissance by incentivizing reshoring and fostering a more secure and resilient supply chain. They include CHIPS Act, Infrastructure Investment, Job Act, Inflation Reduction Act, etc. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned from this article:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Why did Berkshire trimmed its APPL position?</p>
<p>No concern about Apple’s earnings potential, make sense to take some profits as value is now too high.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Right way to look at share buybacks</p>
<p>A business should pay dividends only if it cannot make good use of the excess capital it has. Good use capital means the Return of Equity, which is on average 12% for American companies. If the company is able to allocate capital better than shareholders themselves and provide them with above average returns, it should retain the earnings and allocate capital itself.</p>
<p>Buybacks only makes sense at the right price and buying back shares just to support stock price is not the best action ti take for shareholders. All investment decisions should be price dependent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How would he invest small sums of money?</p>
<p>At the time of market crashes or economic downturns, you find exceptional companies trading at ridiculously cheap prices and that’s your opportunity, When you find those companies fairly priced or overvalued and you look for special situations while holding onto your positions in those exceptional companies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Views on capital allocation</p>
<p>Study picking businesses, not stocks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Investing in foreign countries</p>
<p>America has been a great country for building wealth and capitalist democracy is the best system of governance ever invented.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Advice on job picking</p>
<p>Remember Steve Jobs’ famous words in the Stanford Commencement speech he gave before his death: “Keep looking, don’t settle!”</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the importance of culture</p>
<p>In Berkshire culture, shareholders feel themselves as the owners of the businesses. Greg Abel will keep the culture alive in the post-Buffett period and this will automatically attract top talent to a place where they are given full responsibility and trust.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When to sell stocks</p>
<ol>
<li>A bigger opportunity comes up, 2.  something drastically changes in the business, and 3. to raise money</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Effects of consumer behavior on investment decisions</p>
<p>Two types of businesses have durable competitive advantage: 1) Lowest cost suppliers of products and services, 2) suppliers of unique products and services.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Very few AI research work don’t have # 1 and # 3 flaws and they are really good hard-core work. Time is required to verify whether they are generalizable, widely applicable or not. Especially nowadays the process of scientific research is very different from previous years where there was usually a decade between starting your work and publishing it.</p>
<p>This article highlights some publications in complex embedding and looked into how they improved embeddings by using complex numbers. Current challenges in embedding are 1) sensitivity to outliers 2) limited capacity in capture complex relationship in unstructured text, 3) inconsistency in pairwise rankings of similarities, and 4) computational cost. The next generation complex embedding is benefitting from the following pillars: 1) complex geometry provides richer space to capture nuanced relationships and handle outliers, 2) orthogonality allows each dimension to be independent and distinct, 3) contrastive learning can be used to minimize the distance between similar pairs and maximize the distance between dissimilar pairs. Complex embeddings have a lot of advantages: 1) increasing representation capacity with two components (real and imaginary) of complex numbers, 2) complex geometry allows for orthogonality and thus improves generalization, and also allows use to reach stable convergence quickly, 3) robust features can be captured which improves robustness, and 4) solved limitation of cosine similarity (saturation zones which lead to vanishing gradients during optimization) by angle optimization in complex space.</p>

<p>Good paper review article. Highlights key discussions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mixtral 8x22B: The key idea is to replace each feed-forward module in a transformer architecture with 8 expert layers. It achieves lower active parameters (cost) and higher performance (MMLU).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Llama 3: The main difference between Llama 3 and Llama 2 are 1) vocab size has been increased, 2) used grouped-query attention, 3) used both PPO &amp; DPO. The key research finding is that the more data the better performance, no matter what model size is. </p>
<p>“Llama 3 8B might be the most interesting all-rounder for fine-tuning as it can be fine-tuned no a single GPU when using LoRA.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Phi-3: Key characteristics are 1) it’s based on Llama architecture, 2) trained on 5x fewer tokens than Llama 3, 3) used the same tokenizer with a vocab size of 32064 as Llama2, much smaller than Llama 3 vocab size, 4) has only 3.8B parameters, less than half the size of Llama 3 8B, 5) secret sauce is dataset quality over quantity - it’s trained on heavily filtered web data and synthetic data. </p>
<p>“Phi-3 is very appealing for mobile devices. A quantized version of it can run on an iPhone 14.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>OpenELM: key characteristics are 1) 4 relatively small sizes: 270M, 450M,1.1B, and 3B, 2) instruct version trained with rejection sampling and DPO, 3) slightly better than OLMo in performance, even though trained on 2x fewer tokens, 4) main architecture teak - a layer-wise scaling strategy, 5) sampled a relatively smaller subset of 1.8T tokens from various public datasets, but no clear rationale for subsampling, 6) one main research finding is that there is no clear difference between LoRA and DoRA for parameter efficient fine-tuning.</p>
<p>About the layer-wise scaling strategy: 1) there are N transformer blocks in a model, 2) layers are gradually widened from the early to the later transformer blocks, so for each block: a) number of heads are increased, b) dimension of each layer is increased.</p>
</li>
<li><p>DPO vs PPO: The main difference between DPO and PPO is that “DPO does not require training a separate reward model but uses a classification-like objective to update LLM directly”. </p>
<p>Key findings of the paper and best practices suggested: 1) PPO is generally better than DPO if you use it correctly. DPO suffers from out-of-distribution data, which means instruction data is different from preference data. The solution could be to “add a supervised instruction fine-tuning round on the preference dataset before following up with DPO fine-tuning.”, 2) If you use DPO, make sure to perform SFT on preference data first, 3) “iterative DPO which involves labeling additional data with an existing reward model is better than DPO on existing preference data.”, 4) “If you use PPO, the key is to use large batch sizes, advantage normalization, and parameter update via exponential moving average.”, 5) though PPO is generally better, DPO is more straightforward and will still be a popular go-to option, 6) both can be used. Recall the pipeline behind Llama3: pretraining -&gt; SFT -&gt; rejection sampling -&gt; PPO -&gt; DPO.</p>

<p>This is a very good read about developing Gen AI product for business by using pre-trained LLM. This article elaborates how this product is designed, how each part works specifically, what works and what does not work, what has been improving, and what has been struggling. Some takeaways for me are </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Supervised fine tuning step was done by embedding-based retrieval (EBR) powered by an in-memory database to inject response examples into prompts. </p>
</li>
<li><p>An organizational structure was designed to ensure communication consistency: one horizontal engineering pod for global templates and styles, and several vertical engineering pods for specific tasks such as summarization, job fit assessment, interview tips, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tricky work: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Developing end to end automatic evaluation pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Skills in dynamically discover and invoke APIs &#x2F; agents.</p>
<p>This requires input and output to be ‘LLM friendly’ - JSON or YAML schemes. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Supervised fine tuning by injected responses of internal database.</p>
<p>As evaluation becoming more sophisticated, prompt engineering needs to be improved to reach high quality&#x2F;evaluation scores. The difficulty is that quality scores shoot up fast then plateau so it’s hard to reach a very high score in the late improvement stage. This makes prompt engineering more like an art rather than science. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Tradeoff of capacity and latency</p>
<p>Chain of Thoughts can improve quality and accuracy of responses, but increase latency. TimeToFirstToken (TTFT) &amp; TimeBetweenTokens (TBT) are important to utilization but need to be bounded to limit latency. Besides, they also intend to implement end to end streaming and async non-blocking pipeline.</p>

<p><em>The concept of open source was devised to ensure developers could use, study, modify, and share software without restrictions. But AI works in fundamentally different ways, and key concepts don’t translate from software to AI neatly, says Maffulli.</em></p>
<p><em>But depending on your goal, dabbling with an AI model could require access to the trained model, its training data, the code used to preprocess this data, the code governing the training process, the underlying architecture of the model, or a host of other, more subtle details.</em></p>
<p><em>Which ingredients you need to meaningfully study and modify models remains open to interpretation.</em> </p>
<p><em>both Llama 2 and Gemma come with licenses that restrict what users can do with the models. That’s anathema to open-source principles: one of the key clauses of the Open Source Definition outlaws the imposition of any restrictions based on use cases.</em></p>
<p><em>All the major AI companies have simply released pretrained models, without the data sets on which they were trained.

<p>This article argues that the definitions of open-source AI are problematic. ‘Open’ models either have restriction on usage or don’t release details of training data. This does not fit traditional definition of ‘open source’. However, people argue that for the special case of AI, we need different definition of open source. As long as the definition remains vague, it’s problematic, because big tech will define open-source AI to be what suits it. </p>

There is a malicious script called <code>build-to-host.m4</code> which checks for various conditions like the architecture of the machine.

<p>Human comes into a new stage of learning: smartly asking AI questions to get answers as accurate as possible. So prompt engineering is a very important skill in AI era. In order to master prompt engineering, we need to have divide and conquer mindset, perfect first-principle thinking, critical thinking, and skepticism.</p>

<p><em>If we had infinite capacity for memorisation, it’s clear the transformer approach is better than the human approach - it truly is more effective. But it’s less efficient - transformers have to store so much information about the past that might not be relevant. Transformers (🤖) only decide what’s relevant at <strong>recall time</strong>. The innovation of Mamba (🐍) is allowing the model better ways of forgetting earlier - it’s focusing by choosing what to discard using <strong>Selectivity</strong>, throwing away less relevant information at <strong>memory-making time</strong>.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>A very in-depth explanation of Mamba architecture. So the main difference between Transformer and Mamba is that Transformer stores all past information and decides what is relevant at recall time. While Mamba uses Selectivity to decide what to discard earlier. Mamba ensures both efficiency and effectiveness (space complexity reduces from O(n) to O(1), time complexity reduces from O(n^2) to O(n)). If Transformer has high effectiveness and low efficiency due to large state, and RNN has high efficiency and low effectiveness due to small state, Mamba is in between - Mamba selectively and dynamically compress data into the state.</p>

<p>Basically this study demonstrates that GPT-4 is able to outperform a leading model that was fine-tuned specifically for medical application by Medprompt - a composition of several prompting strategies. This shows that fine-tuning might not be necessary in the future though it can boost performance, it is resource-intensive and cost-prohibitive. Simple prompting strategies could serve to transform generalist models into specialists and extending benefits of models to new domains and applications. Similar study was also done in finance domain by JP Morgan with similar results.</p>

<p><em>In turn, any internal state of the model can be represented in terms of a few active features instead of many active neurons.

<p>This is an amazing work towards AI safety by Anthropic. The main goal is to understand the inner workings of AI models and identify how millions of concepts are represented inside Claude Sonnet, so that developers can better control AI safety. Previous progress of this work was to match pattern of neuron activations (“features”) to human-interpretable concepts by technique called “dictionary learning”. Now they are scaling up the technique to the vastly larger AI language models. Below is a list of key experiments and findings. </p>
<ol>
<li>Extracted millions of features from the middle layer of Claude 3.0 Sonnet. Features have a depth, breadth, and abstraction reflecting Sonnet’s advanced capabilities.</li>
<li>Find more abstract features - responding to bugs in code, discussion of gender biases in professions, etc.</li>
<li>Measure a “distance” between features based on which neurons appeared in their activation patterns. They find that features with similar concept are close to each other. This demonstrates internal organization of concepts in AI model correspond to human notions of similarity.</li>
<li>By artificially amplifying or suppressing features, they see how Claude’s responses change. This shows that features can be used to change how a model acts.</li>
<li>For the purpose of AI safety, they find features corresponding to the capabilities with misuse potential (code backdoors, developing bio-weapons), different forms of biases (gender discrimination, racist claims about crime), and potentially problematic AI behavior (power-seeking, manipulation, secrecy)</li>
<li>For previous concern about sycophancy, they also find a feature associated with sycophantic praise.</li>
</ol>
<p>This study proposed a good approach to ensure AI safety: use the technique described here to monitor AI systems for dangerous behaviors and to debias outcomes.</p>

<p><em>Nadella, similarly, needed to break up Windows and end Ballmer’s dreams of vertical domination so that the company could build a horizontal services business that, a few years later, could actually make Windows into a differentiated operating system that might, for the first time in years, actually drive new customer acquisition.</em></p>

<p>It’s crazy that what is happening right now in some of the colleges is not to protest sexual violence as a tool of war by Hamas. This kind of ignorance or denial of sexual violence is horrible. People are so polarized to black and white that if something does not fit into their view, they are going to reject it. There are more than two sides to the Middle East story, one of them is sexual violence - mass rape, genital mutilation of men and women, women tied to trees naked bloody leg spread…</p>
<p>There is a long history of the involvement of women’s bodies in Wars. It’s only 30 years ago, people started to say rape is not a tool of War and should be prosecuted as a war crime against humanity. The feminist, human rights, and civil rights groups made this happen. Now it happened again in Gaza according to the report released by U.N., however there are a lot difficulties in proving and testifying the truth e.g. they couldn’t locate a single victim, or they don’t have the victim rights to take pictures. But victims are dead and they cannot speak up. Denying the fact of sexual violence is just unacceptable. And there is such a great <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAr9oGSXgak&ab_channel=ScreamsBeforeSilence">documentary</a> shedding lights on the unspeakable sexual violence committed on Oct 7, 2023 that I think everyone should watch.</p>
<p>Good news is that the testimony of eyewitness meets the criteria of any international or global court. So crimes can be proven by any eyewitness for sure.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>John Schulman is a research scientist and cofounder of OpenAI, focusing on Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. He gave a talk on making AI more truthful on Apr 24, 2023 in UCB. The ideas and discussions are still helpful and insightful today.</p>
<p>In this talk, John discussed the issue of hallucination with large language models. He claims that behavior cloning or supervised learning is not enough to fix the hallucination problem, instead, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can help improve the model’s truthfulness by 1) adjusting output distribution so model is allowed to express uncertainty, challenge premise, admit error, and 2) learning behavior boundaries. In his conceptual model, fine-tuning leads the model to hallucinate when it lacks knowledge. Retrieval and citing external sources can help improve verifiability. John discusses models that can browse the web to answer technical questions, citing relevant sources. </p>
<p>John mentioned three open problems in LLM: 1) how to train models to express uncertainty in natural language, 2) go beyond what human labelers can easily verify (“scalable oversight”), and 3) optimizing for true knowledge rather than human approval.</p>

<p>A great interview with the CEO of Mistral Arthur Mensch on the topic of sovereignty and open models as a business strategy. Here are some highlighted points from Arthur:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open-source is going to solidify in the future. It is an infrastructure technology and at the end of the day it should be modifiable and owned by customers. Now Mistral has two offerings, open source one and commercial one, and the aim is to find out the business model to sustain the open source development.</li>
<li>The things that Mistral is best at 1) training model, and 2) specializing models. </li>
<li>The way they think about partnership strategy is to look at what enterprises would need, where they were operating, where the developers were operating, and figure out the channels that would facilitate adoption and spread. To be a multiplatform solution and to replicate the solution to different platforms is a strategy that Mistral is following.</li>
<li>There is still an efficiency upper bound to be pushed. Other than compute to spend on pre-training, there is still research to do on improving model efficiency and strength. On architecture side, we can be more efficient than plain Transformer which spends same amount of compute on every token. Mistral is making model faster. By making model faster, we open up a lot of applications that involve an LLM as a basic brick and then we can figure out how to do planning, explorations, etc. By increasing efficiency, we open up areas of research.</li>
<li>Meta has more GPUs than Mistral do. But Mistral has a good concentration of GPU (number of GPU per person). This is the way to be as efficient as possible to come up with creative ways of training models. Also unit economics need to be considered to make sure that $1 that you spend on training compute eventually accrues to more than $1 revenue.</li>
<li>Transformer is not an optimal architecture. It’s been out there for 7 years now. Everything is co-adapted to it such as training methods, debug methods, the algorithms, and hardware. It’s challenging to find a better one and also beat the baseline. But there are a lot of research on modification of attention to boost memory efficiencies and a lot of things can be done in that direction and similar directions.</li>
<li>About AI regulations and EU AI Act, Arthur states that it does not solve the actual problem of how to make AI safe. Because making AI safe is a hard problem (stochastic model), different from the way we evaluate software before. It’s more like a product problem rather than a regulation problem. We need to rethink continuous integration, verifications, etc and make sure everything is happening as it should be.</li>
<li>Mistral recently released Le Chat to help enterprise start incorporating AI. It gives an assistant that is contextualized on their enterprise data. It’s a tool to be closer to the end user to get feedback for the developer platform and also a tool to get the enterprise into GenAI.</li>

<p><strong>Open Source AI is AI we can Trust — with Soumith Chintala of Meta AI</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.latent.space/p/soumith">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Synthetic data is the next rage of LLM. Soumith pointed out that synthetic data is where we as humans already have good symbolic models off, we need to impart that knowledge to neural networks, and we figured out the synthetic data is a vehicle to impart this knowledge to it. Related to synthetic data but in an unusual way, there is new research on distilling GPT-4 by creating synthetic data from GPT-4, creating mock textbooks inspired by Phi-2 and then fine tuning open source models like Lambda.  </p>
<p>Open source means different things to different people and we haven’t had a community norm definition yet at this very early stage of LLM. When being asked about open source, people in this field are used to highlight the definition of it in advance. In the open source topic, Soumith pointed out that the most beneficial value of open is it makes the distribution very wide and available with no friction so that people can do transformative things in a way that is very accessible. </p>

<p><em>I think the reason why the car could have been completely reimagined by Apple is that they have a level of credibility and trust that I think probably no other company has, and absolutely no other tech company has. I think this was the third Steve Jobs story that I left out but in 2001, I launched a 99 cent download store and Steve Jobs just ran total circles around us, but the reason he was able to is he had all the credibility to go to the labels and get deals done for licensing music that nobody could get done before. I think that is an example of what Apple’s able to do which is to use their political capital to change the rules. So if the thing that we could all want is safer roads and autonomous vehicles, there are regions in every town and city that could be completely converted to level 5 autonomous zones. If I had to pick one company that had the credibility to go and change those rules, it’s them. Because they could demonstrate that there was a methodical safe approach to doing something. So the point is that even in these categories that could be totally reimagined, it’s not for a lack of imagination, again it just goes back to a complete lack of will. I understand because if you had 200B dollars of capital on your balance sheet, I think it’s probably easy to get fat and lazy. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em> </p>

<p><em>If you are a developer, the key thing to understand is where does model innovation end and your innovation begin, because if you get that wrong you will end up doing a bunch of stuff that the model will just obsolete in a few months. - David Sacks</em></p>
<p><em>The incentive for these folks is going to be push this stuff into the open source. Because if you solve a problem that’s operationally necessary for your business but it isn’t the core part of your business, what incentive do you have to really keep investing in this for the next 5 to 10 years to improve it. You are much better off release it in the open source, let the rest of the community take it over so that it’s available to everybody else, otherwise you are going to be stuck supporting it, and then if and when you ever wanted to switch out a model, GPT-4o, Claude, Llama, it’s going to be costly. The incentive to just push towards open source in this market if you will is so much meaningful than any other market. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>I think the other thing that is probably true is a big measure at Google on the search page in terms of search engineer performance was the bounceback rate, meaning someone does a search, they go off to another site and they come back because they didn’t get the answer they wanted. Then one box launched which shows a short answer on the top, which basically keeps people from having a bad search experience, because they get the result right away. So a key metric is they are going to start to discover which vertical searches will provide the user a better experience than them jumping off to a third party page to get the same content. And then they will be able to monetize that content that they otherwise were not participating in the monetization of. So I think the real victim in all this is that long tale of content on the internet that probably gets cannibalized by the snippet one box experience within the search function. And then I do think that the revenue per search query in some of those categories actually has the potential to go up not down. You keep people on the page so you get more search volume there, you get more searches because of the examples you gave. And then when people do stay, you now have the ability to better monetize that particular search query, because you otherwise would have lost it to the third party content page. Keeping more of the experience integrated they could monetize the search per query higher and they are going to have more queries, and then they are going to have the quality of the queries go up. Going back to our earlier point about precision vs accuracy, my guess is there’s a lot of hedge fund type folks doing a lot of this Precision type of analysis trying to break apart search queries by vertical and try to figure out what the net effect will be of having better AI driven box and snippets. And my guess is that is why there is a lot of buying activity happening. I can tell you Meta and Amazon do not have an Isomorphic Lab and Waymo sitting inside their business, that suddenly pops to a couple hundred billion of market cap and Google does have a few of those. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>One thing I would say about big companies like Google or Microsoft is that the power of your monopoly determines how many mistakes you get to make. So think about Microsoft completely missed iPhone, remember they screwed up the whole smartphone era and it didn’t matter. Same thing here with Google, they completely screwed up AI. They invented the Transformer, completely missed LLMs. Then they had that fiasco where they have black George Washington. It doesn’t matter, they can make 10 mistakes but their monopoly is so strong, that they can finally get it right by copying the innovator, and they are probably going to be come 5T dollar company.  - David Sacks</em></p>

<p><em>When you are over earning so massively, the rational thing to do for other actors in the arena is to come and attack that margin, and give it to people for slightly cheaper slightly faster slightly better so you can take share. So I think what you’re seeing and what you will see even more now is this incentive for Silicon Valley who has been really reticent to put money into chips, really reticent to put money into hardware. They are going to get pulled into investing this space because there is no choice. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>Why? It’s not that intel was a worse company, but it’s that everything else caught up. And the economic value went to things that sat above them in the stack, then it want to Cisco for a while right, then after Cisco, it went to the browser companies for a little bit, then it went to the app companies, then it went to the device companies, then it went to the mobile companies. So you see this natural tendency for value to push up the stack over time. For AI, we’ve done the step one which is now you’ve given all this value to NVIDIA and now we are going to see it being reallocated. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>The reason why they are asking these questions is that if you go back to the doom dot come boom in 1999, you can see that Cisco had this incredible run. And if you overlay the stock price of Nvidia, it seems to be following that same trajectory. And what happened with Cisco is that when the doc come crash came in 2000, Cisco stock lost a huge part of its value. Obviously Cisco is still around today and it’s a valuable company, but it just hasn’t ever regained the type of market cap it had. The reason this happened is because Cisco got commoditized. So the success and market cap of that company attracted a whole bunch of new entrance and they copied Cisco’s products until they were total commodities. So the question is whether that happened to Nvidia. I think the difference here is that at the end of the day Network equipment which Cisco produced was pretty easy to copy, whereas if you look at Nvidia, these GPU cores are really complicated to make. So it’s a much more complicated product to copy. And then on top of that, they are already in the R&amp;D cycle for the next chip. So I think you can make the case that Nvidia has a much better moat than Cisco. - David Sacks</em></p>
<p><em>I think Nvidia is going to get pulled into competing directly with the hyperscalers. So if you were just selling chips, you probably wouldn’t, but these are big bulky actual machines, then all of a sudden you are like well why don’t I just create my own physical plant and just stack these things, and create racks and racks of these machines. It’s not a far stretch especially because Nvidia actually has the software interface that everybody uses which is CUDA. I think it’s likely that Nvidia goes on a full frontal assault against GCP and Amazon and Microsoft. That’s going to really complicate the relationship that those folks have with each other, but I think it’s inevitable because how do you defend an enormously large market cap, you are forced to go into businesses that are equally lucrative. Now if I look inside of compute and look at the adjacent categories, they are not going to all of a sudden start a competitor to TikTok or a social network, but if you look at the multi hundred billion revenue businesses that are adjacent to the markets that Nvidia enables, the most obvious ones are the hyperscalers. So they are going to be forced to compete otherwise their market cap will shrink and I don’t think they want that, and then it’s going to create a very complicated set of incentives for Microsoft and Google and Meta and Apple and all the rest. And that’s also going to be an accelerant, they are going to pump so much money to help all of these upstarts.  - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>Economy is bad without recognizing that it is an inflationary experience whereas economists use the definition of “economic growth” being gross product, and so if gross product or gross revenue is going up they are like oh the economy is healthy we are growing. But the truth is we are funding that growth with leverage at the national level the federal level and at the household a domestic level. We are borrowing money to inflate the revenue numbers , and so the GDP goes up but the debt is going higher, and so the ability for folks to support themselves and buy things that they want to buy and continue to improve their condition in life has declined if things are getting worse… The average American’s ability to improve their condition has largely been driven by their ability to borrow not by their earnings. - David Friedberg</em></p>

<p><strong>The Platonic Representation Hypothesis</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07987">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting paper to read if you like philosophy. This paper argues that there is a platonic representation as a result of convergence of AI models towards a shared statistical model of reality. They show that there is a growing similarity in data representation across different model architectures, training objectives, and data modalities, as the model size, data size, and task diversity are growing. They also proposed three hypothesis for the representation convergence: 1) The multitask scaling hypothesis, 2) The capacity hypothesis, and 3) The simplicity bias hypothesis. And it definitely worths reading the counterexamples and limitations. </p>

<p>Startup EveryONE Medicine aims to develop drugs designed based on genetic information for individual children who have rare, life-threatening neurological diseases. Since the number of patients with diseases caused by rare mutation is significant, the market share is large if EveryONE can scale its process. Although the cost won’t be the same as a standard drugmaker that runs large clinical trials, the challenge is safety without a standard clinical-testing protocol. To be responsible to patients, the initial drugs will have a temporary effect and a wide therapeutic window, so the potential toxicity will be minimized or stopped if there is.</p>

<p>In Nov 2023, NASA’s over 46-year-old Voyager 1 spacecraft started sending nonsense to Earth. Voyager 1 was initially intended to study Jupiter and Saturn and was built to survive only 5 years of flight, however the trajectory was forged further and further into space and so the mission converted from a two-planet mission to an interstellar mission.</p>
<p>In Dec 2023, the mission team restarted the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS)  but failed to return the subsystem to functional state. On Mar 1 2023, they sent a command “poke” to the probe and received a response on Mar 3. On Mar 10, the mission team finally determined the response carried a readout of FDS memory. By comparing the readout with those received before the issue, the team confirmed that 3% of FDS memory was corrupted. On Apr 4, the team concluded the affected code was contained on a computer chip. To solve the problem, the team decided to divide these affected code into smaller sections and to insert those smaller sections into other operative places in the FDS memory. During Apr 18-20, the team sent out the orders to move some of the affected code and received responses with intelligible systems information. </p>

<p>Berkeley based startup Profluent Bio used an AI based protein language model to create and train on an entirely new library of Cas proteins that do not exist in nature today and eventually find one called ‘OpenCRISPR-1’ that is able to replace or improve the ones that are on the market today. The goal of this AI model is to learn what sequence of DNA generated what structure of protein that’s really good at gene editing. The new library of Cas proteins is created by simulation of trillions of letters. They made ‘OpenCRISPR-1’ publicly available under an open source license so anyone can use this particular Cas protein.</p>

<p>Paramount’s stock declined 44% in 2022 and another 12% in 2023. It’s experiencing declining revenue as consumers abandon traditional pay-TV and it’s losing streaming business. Berkshire sold its entire Paramount shares in March 2023 and soon Sony Pictures and Apollo Globals Management reached out to Paramount board expressing interest of acquisition. Now Paramount decided to open negotiation with them after exclusive talks with Hollywood studio Skydance. This deal would break the Paramount and potentially transform the media landscape if successful. Otherwise an office of the CEO as the replacement of CEO Bob Bakish will be preparing a long term plan for the company.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Previously, Google DeepMind AlphaFold project took 3D images of proteins and the DNA sequence that codes for those proteins and then they built a predictive model that predicted the 3D structure of protein base on DNA sequence. What is difference in AlphaFold 3 is that all small molecules are included. The way how small molecules are bind together with the protein is part of the predictive model. This is a breakthrough in that off target effect could be minimized by taking consideration of other molecules’ interactions in the biochemistry environment. Google has a drug development subsidiary called Isomorphic Labs. They kept all of IP for AlphaFold 3. They published a web viewer for non-commercial scientists to do fundamental research but only Isomorphic Labs can make it for commercial use. </p>

<p><em>Feeling deep loneliness on New York City’s bustling streets. When I was in small town, I’ve never said goodbye such frequently.</em></p>
<p>Back to the topic:</p>
<p>When we talk about investment, we talk about economic values. Current situation of AI is very similar to Cisco’s in 2000. Cisco as an internet company spread the capacity of the World Wide Web, but sooner people realized that there is no economic value in internet company, instead, opportunities are in e-commerce etc. AI is a tool very similar to web tech. Currently, with heightened expectations, people are allocating investments and capital expenditure in AI model development, however, end-user demand is unclear and revenue is relatively minimal. This situation makes AI look like a bubble from a very long term perspective.</p>
<p>Stepping closer to it, there is still room in the market to party. GPUs for training and inference are increasingly on demand. First round of beneficiaries are Cloud and Ad. Second round could be hardware or something else. Although it looks like a Capitalism’s scam which is getting more money to the big tech, as small open-source models are released, moats are expected to be  disintegrated and distributed. I’ve seen more and more enterprises going to have Gen AI integrated to their business or operation now. Enterprise is going to be continuously transformed to be more efficient and productive, as well as human life with this long lasting attention on AI. This kind of long lasting attention and consistent innovation are something different from internet tech in 2000 and will probably create a momentum against bubble.</p>

<p><em>Bridging the customer-worker divide can result in higher customer trust and platform commitment, both by the customer and the worker.</em> </p>
<p><em>To start, platforms need to increase transparency, reduce information asymmetry, and price their services clearly, allowing customers to better understand what they are paying for rather than only seeing an aggregated total at the end of the transaction. This, in turn, can help customers get used to the idea that if workers are to be paid fairly, gig work cannot be a free or low-cost service.</em></p>

<p><em>TCP&#x2F;IP unlocked new economic value by dramatically lowering the cost of connections. Similarly, blockchain could dramatically reduce the cost of transactions. It has the potential to become the system of record for all transactions. If that happens, the economy will once again undergo a radical shift, as new, blockchain-based sources of influence and control emerge.</em></p>
<p><em>“Smart contracts” may be the most transformative blockchain application at the moment. These automate payments and the transfer of currency or other assets as negotiated conditions are met. For example, a smart contract might send a payment to a supplier as soon as a shipment is delivered. A firm could signal via blockchain that a particular good has been receivedor the product could have GPS functionality, which would automatically log a location update that, in turn, triggered a payment. We’ve already seen a few early experiments with such self-executing contracts in the areas of venture funding, banking, and digital rights management.</em></p>
<p><em>The implications are fascinating. Firms are built on contracts, from incorporation to buyer-supplier relationships to employee relations. If contracts are automated, then what will happen to traditional firm structures, processes, and intermediaries like lawyers and accountants? And what about managers? Their roles would all radically change. Before we get too excited here, though, let’s remember that we are decades away from the widespread adoption of smart contracts. They cannot be effective, for instance, without institutional buy-in. A tremendous degree of coordination and clarity on how smart contracts are designed, verified, implemented, and enforced will be required. We believe the institutions responsible for those daunting tasks will take a long time to evolve, And the technology challenges especially security are daunting.</em></p>
<p><strong>―  “The Truth About Blockchain”, Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain">Article</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the second Blockchain related article I have read from Harvard Business Review. Different authors have different perspectives. Unlike the previous article with a lot of concerns and cautions about Web3, this article seems more optimistic. It proposed a framework for adopting blockchain to revolutionize modern business, and a guidance to Blockchain investment. It points out that Blockchain has great potentials in boosting the efficiency and reducing the cost for all transactions and then explained the reason why the adoption of Blockchain would be slow by making a comparison with TCP&#x2F;IP, which took more than 30 years to reshape the economy by dramatically lowering the cost of connections. This is an interesting comparison: e-mail enabled bilateral messaging as the first application of TCP&#x2F;IP, while bitcoin enables bilateral financial transactions as the first application of Blockchain. It reminds me about what people (Jun Lei, Huateng Ma, Lei Ding, etc) were thinking about internet mindset and business model back in 2000s.</p>
<p>In the end, the authors proposed a four-quadrant framework for adopting Blockchain step by step. The four quadrants are created by two dimensions: novelty (equivalent to the amount of efforts required to ensure users understand the problem) and complexity (equivalent to the amount of coordination and collaboration required to produce values). With the increase of both dimensions, the adoption will require more institutional change. An example of “low novelty and low complexity” is simply adding bitcoin as an alternative transaction method. An example of “low novelty and high complexity” is building a new, fully formed cryptocurrency system which requires wide adoption from every monetary transaction party and consumers’ complete understanding of cryptocurrency. An example of “high novelty and low complexity” is building a local private network on which multiple organizations are connected via a distributed ledger. An example of “high novelty and high complexity” is building “smart contracts”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s been reported that there are over 1000 Indian workers behind the cameras of Just Walk Out. It sounds dystopian and reminds me of “Snowpiercer” movie in 2013. In 2022, about 700 of every 1000 Just Walk Out sales had to be reviewed by Amazon’s team in India, according to The Information. Amazon spokesperson explained that the technology is made by AI (computer vision and deep learning) while it does rely on human moderators and data labelers. Amazon clarified that it’s not true that Just Walk Out relies on human reviewers. They said object detection and receipt generation are completely AI powered, so no human watching live videos. But human are responsible for labeling and annotation for data preparation, which also requires watching videos.</p>
<p>I guess the technology was not able to complete the task end-to-end by itself without supervision or it’s still on the developing stage? I believe it could be Amazon’s strategy to build and test Just Walk Out, Amazon Dash Cart, and Amazon One at the same time while improving AI system, since they are “just getting started”. As Amazon found out that customers prefer Dash Cart in large stores, it has already expanded Dash Cart to all Amazon Fresh stores as well as third-party grocers. And customers prefer Just Walk Out in small stores, so it’s available now in 140+ thrid-party locations. Customers love Amazon One’s security and convenience regardless the scale of stores, so it’s now available at 500+ Whole Foods Market stores, some Amazon stores, and 150+ third-party locations.</p>

<p><em>One page of the Microsoft presentation highlights a variety of “common” federal uses for OpenAI, including for defense. One bullet point under “Advanced Computer Vision Training” reads: “Battle Management Systems: Using the DALL-E models to create images to train battle management systems.” Just as it sounds, a battle management system is a command-and-control software suite that provides military leaders with a situational overview of a combat scenario, allowing them to coordinate things like artillery fire, airstrike target identification, and troop movements. The reference to computer vision training suggests artificial images conjured by DALL-E could help Pentagon computers better “see” conditions on the battlefield, a particular boon for finding — and annihilating — targets.</em></p>
<p><em>OpenAI spokesperson Liz Bourgeous said OpenAI was not involved in the Microsoft pitch and that it had not sold any tools to the Department of Defense. “OpenAI’s policies prohibit the use of our tools to develop or use weapons, injure others or destroy property,” she wrote. “We were not involved in this presentation and have not had conversations with U.S. defense agencies regarding the hypothetical use cases it describes.”</em></p>
<p><em>Microsoft told The Intercept that if the Pentagon used DALL-E or any other OpenAI tool through a contract with Microsoft, it would be subject to the usage policies of the latter company. Still, any use of OpenAI technology to help the Pentagon more effectively kill and destroy would be a dramatic turnaround for the company, which describes its mission as developing safety-focused artificial intelligence that can benefit all of humanity.</em></p>

<p><em>The company also developed a way to diagnose and correct qubit errors without disrupting them, a technique it calls “active syndrome extraction.” The act of measuring a quantum state such as superposition typically destroys it. To avoid this, active syndrome extraction instead learns details about the qubits that are related to noise, as opposed to their quantum states, Svore explains. The ability to account for this noise can permit longer and more complex quantum computations to proceed without failure, all without destroying the logical qubits.</em> </p>

Majority of the models are not groundbreaking but whenever there is big step, you will be aware of it. </p>
<p>Although not necessary to catch up all the news, we at least need to be aware of the main future model features - where modern and future LLMs are heading to: 1) multimodality 2) recall capability 3) reasoning.</p>

<p>What I learned from this interview: The future of Meta AI would be a kind of AI general assistant product where you give it complicated tasks and then it goes away and does them. Meta will probably build bigger clusters. No one has built 1GW data center yet but building it could just be a matter of time. Open source can be both bad and good. People can use LLM to do harmful things, while what Mask worries more about is the concentration of AI, where there is an untrustworthy actor having the super strong AI. Open source software can make AI not getting stuck in one company but can be broadly deployed to a lot of different systems. People can set standards on how it works and AI can get checked and upgraded together. </p>

<p><em>It is clear that inference was going to be a scaled problem. Everyone else had been looking at inference as you take one chip, you run a model on it, it runs whatever. But what happened with AlphaGo was we ported the software over, and even though we had 170 GPUs vs 48 TPUs, the 48 TPUs won 99 out of 100 games with the exact same software. What that meant was compute was going to result in better performance. And so the insight was - let’s build scaled inference.</em></p>
<p><em>(Nvidia) They have the ecosystem. It’s a double-sided market. If they have a kernel-based approach they already won. There’s no catching up. The other way that they are very good is vertical integration and forward integration. What happens is Nvidia over and over again decides that they want to move up the stack, and whatever the customers are doing, they start doing it.</em></p>
<p><em>Nvidia is incredible at training. And I think the design decision that they made including things like HBM, were really oriented around the world back then, which was everything is about training. There weren’t any real world application. None of you guys were really building anything in the wild where you needed super fast inference.</em></p>
<p><em>What we saw over and over again was you would spend 100% of your compute on training, you would get something that would work well enough to go into production, and then it would flip to about 5%-10% training and 90%-95% inference. But the amount of training would stay the same, the inference would grow massively. And so every time we would have a success at Google, all of a sudden, we would have a disaster, we called it the success disaster, where we can’t afford to get enough compute for inference.</em></p>
<p><em>HBM is this High Bandwidth Memory which is required to get performance, because the speed at which you can run these applications depends on how quickly you can read that into memory. There’s a finite supply, it’s only for data centers, so they can’t reach into the supply for mobile or other things, like you can with other parts. Also Nvidia is the largest buyer of super caps in the world and all sorts of other components. The 400 gigabit cables, they’ve bought them all out. So if you want to compete, it doesn’t matter how good of a product you design, they’ve bought out the entire supply chain for years.</em></p>
<p><em>The biggest difference between training and inference is when you are training, the number of tokens that you are training on is measured in month, like how many tokens can we train on this month. In inference, what matters is how many tokens you can generate per millisecond or a couple milliseconds.</em> </p>
<p><em>It’s fair to say that Nvida is the exemplar in training but really isn’t yet the equivalent scaled winner in inference.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to get the latency down, we had to design a completely new chip architecture, we had to design a completely new networking architecture, an entirely new system, an entirely new runtime, an entirely new compiler, and entirely new orchestration layer. We had to throw everything away and it had to be compatible with PyTorch and what other people actually developing in.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Facebook announced that by the end of this year, they are going to have the equivalent of 650000 H100s. By the end of this year, Grok will have deployed 100000 of our LPUs which do outperform the H100s on a throughput and on a latency basis. So we will probably get pretty close to the equivalent of Meta ourselves. By the end of next year, we are going to deploy 1.5M LPUs, for comparison, last year Nvidia deployed a total of 500000 H100s. So 1.5M means Grok will probably have more inference GenAI capacity than all of the hyperscalers and clouds service providers combined. So probably about 50% of the inference compute in the world.</em></p>
<p><em>I get asked a lot should we be afraid of AI and my answer to that is, if  you think back to Galileo, someone who got in a lot of trouble. The reason he got in trouble was he invented the telescope, popularized it, and made some claims that we were much smaller than everyone wanted to believe. The better the telescope got the more obvious it became that we were small. In a large sense, LLMs are the telescope for the mind, it’s become clear that intelligence is larger than we are and it makes us feel really really small and it’s scary. But what happened over time was as we realized the universe was larger than we thought and we got used to that, we started to realize how beautiful it was and our place in the universe. And I think that’s what’s going to happen. We’re going to realize intelligence is more vast than we ever imagined. And we are going to understand our place in it, and we are not going to be afraid of it.</em></p>

<p>This is a very insightful conversation especially in the part of comparison of training and inference. The answer to the final question is fascinating to end the conversation.

It puts the closed models on their heels.

And I think why the market reacted very negatively was that it did not seem that Facebook understood that distinction, that they were way overspending and trying to allocate a bunch of GPU capacity towards inference that didn’t make sense. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>You want to find real durable moats not these like legal arrangement that try to protect your business through these types of contracts. One of the reasons why the industry moves so fast is best practices get shared very quickly, and one of the ways that happens is that everybody is moving around to different companies (average term of employment is 18-36 months). There are people who violate those rules (taking code to the new company etc), and that is definitely breaking the rules, but you are allowed to take with you anything in your head, and it is one of the ways that best practices sort of become more common. - David Sacks</em></p>

<p><strong>ReALM: Reference Resolution As Language Modeling</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20329">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple proposed the ReALM model with 80M, 250M, 1B, and 3B parameters. It can be used on mobile devices and laptops. The task of ReALM is “Given relevant entities and a task the user wants to perform, we wish to extract the entity (or entities) that are pertinent to the current user query. “. The relevant entities can be on-screen entities, conversational entities, and background entities. The analysis shows that ReALM beats MARRs and has similar performance with GPT-4.</p>

<p><strong>Leave No Context Behind: Efficient Infinite Context Transformers with Infini-attention</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07143.pdf">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google introduced the next generation transformer - infini-transformer. It’s able to take infinite length of input without the requirement of more memory or computation. Unlike vanilla attention mechanism in traditional transformer which reset their attention memory after each context window to manage new data, infini-attention retains a compressive memory and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms. The model compresses and reuses key-value states across all segments, allowing it to pull relevant information from any part of the document.</p>

<p><em>AI agents are starting to transcend their digital origins and enter the physical world through devices like smartphones, smart glasses, and robots. These technologies are typically used by individuals who are not AI experts. To effectively assist them, Embodied AI (EAI) agents must possess a natural language interface and a type of “common sense” rooted in human-like perception and understanding of the world.</em> </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The OpenEQA introduced by Meta is the first open vocab benchmark dataset for the formulation of Embodied Question Answering (EQA) task of understanding environment either by memory or by active exploration, well enough to answer questions in natural language. Meta also provided an automatic LLM-powered evaluation protocol to evaluate the performance of SOTA models like GPT-4V and see whether it’s close to human-level performance.</p>
<p>OpenEQA looks like the very first step towards “world model” and I’m excited that it’s coming. The dataset contains over 1600 high-quality human generated questions drawn from over 180 real-world environments. If the future AI agent can answer N questions over N real-world environments, where N is approximately infinity, we can call it God intelligence. But we are probably not able to achieve that “world model” at least with my limited imagination, because it requires un-infinite compute resources and there can be ethical issues. However, if we take one step back, instead of creating “world model”, a “human society model” or “transformation model”, etc, sounds more possible. Limiting question to a specific pain point problem and limiting environment according to it would both save resources and contribute AI’s value to human society.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>OpenELM is a small language model (SLM) tailored for on-device applications. The models range from 270M to 3B parameters, which are suitable for deployment on mobile devices and PCs. The key innovation is called “layer-wise scaling architecture”. It allocates fewer parameters to the initial transformer layers and gradually increases the number of parameters towards the final layers. This approach optimizes compute resources while remaining high accuracy. Inference of OpenELM can be run on Intel i9 workstation with RTX 4090 GPU and an M2 Max MacBook Pro.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft launched Phi-3 family including mini (3.8B), small (7B), and medium (14B). These models are designed to run efficiently on both mobile devices and PCs. All models leverage a transformer decoder architecture. The performance is comparable to larger models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT3.5. It supports a default of 4K context length but is expandable to 128K through LongRope technology. The models are trained on web data and synthetic data, using two-phase approach which enhances both general knowledge and specialized skills (e.g. logical reasoning), and fine tuned in specific domains. Mini (3.8B) is especially optimized for mobile usage, requiring 1.8GB memory when compressed to 4-bits and processing 12+ tokens per second on mobile devices such as iPhone 14.</p>

<p><em>Music teacher never answered my question: why should Triangle be included in a piece of music while there are already 10+ instruments and sounds loud in there? I accidentally got the answer from my dance teacher. She said: “different people have different hearing capabilities and thus different understanding of music, what dancers are doing is actually to interpret or reproduce music.”</em></p>
<p>Back to the topic:</p>
<p>There is always a lot to learn about strategic thinking from Zuck. Here are some of his smart strategies behind open source I’ve learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc6uFV9CJGg">interview</a>, Zuck’s point of open source is to avoid concentration of AI while he didn’t ignore the harmful consequences of open source saying that it’s our responsibility to do a good job of reducing harm. There are several benefits of open source, one is that people could figure out cheaper ways to develop models so it won’t cost too much resource. The other benefit is that they could enable more efficient developments and vertical use cases in a lot of different systems. Take Google and Apple for example, their mobile ecosystems restricted what developers could build or what features they could launch on them.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>For companies like Meta with well-established network effect, they really don’t need to have the best model. AI’s content creation potential benefits Meta’s platforms, even if the models are not exclusively theirs. This is the most reasonable reason from business perspective and was stated in an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/META-Q4-2023-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">earnings call</a>. </li>
<li>By open-sourcing models, Meta started developer communities which can contribute to whatever the ecosystem Meta built and help solidify the advantage of it. Most recent example is the open model of Horizon OS which powers its VR headsets. It allows developers and creators to take advantage of these technologies to create MR experiences and grow business on it. Then Meta Quest Store can be quickly established.</li>
<li>Models themselves are not a moats. Moats are built through data and habits. Open source eventually makes economic value of foundational model disintegrated. There will be no value in foundational model economically and there is probably less point for VC to plow billions of dollars into a foundational model development startup. The potential economic values are in 100K+ developers iteratively and quickly training and deploying the open source models for specific business use cases. Inference will be way more important than training. So attention and money will be less concentrated to products like OpenAI GPT series and Nvidia training GPU but more on Cloud platforms with inference GPU for personal and business usage.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Looking at various LLM models developed in the past few months, we are absolutely pursuing LLM with larger number of parameters. This is counterintuitive to the concept of ‘parsimony’ in traditional machine learning, which means using a minimum number of parameters necessary to train the model therefore preventing overfitting problem on unseen data. But as we’ve all seen that in computer vision and natural language processing, generative models with larger number of parameters tend to outperform their more parsimonious counterparts. There are probably two main hypotheses: 1) increasing the amount of data can improve the performance of LLM, then the huge size of dataset requires large number of parameters otherwise the model is going to be underfitting, and 2) large number of parameters allow the model to generate high-resolution pictures, provide more detailed answers, gain the capability of solving more intricate problems.</p>
<p>The paper “Scaling Law for Neural Language Models” published in 2020 by OpenAI introduced the concept of scaling law - the performance of NLM is highly correlated with the scale of network, the size of dataset, and compute, but weakly correlated with model architecture (number of layers, depth, and width). There’s been a debate on this scaling law. OpenAI believes that parameter size is more important - for every x10 increase of compute, dataset size should be increased by x1.8, and parameter size should be increased by x5.5. However, DeepMind believes that they are equally important - for every x10 increase of compute, dataset size and parameter size should both be increased by x3.16.</p>
<p>The paper “Bigger is not Always Better: Scaling Properties of Latent Diffusion Models” published by Google this month summarized an investigation of scaling law on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) specifically. It points out that “when operating under a given inference budget, smaller models frequently outperform their larger equivalents in generating high-quality results”. It turns out that with the same compute capacity, smaller model with large number of training steps can outperform larger model with small number of training steps. The existence of trade-off here is due to the fact that total compute is proportional to the number of training steps times GFLOPS (number of rounds of one forward propagation and one back propagation). But with the same number of training steps, it’s still true that the larger model the better performance. As the expense is calculated roughly by the parameter size times dataset size, this finding opens up new pathways to enhance LDM’s generative capacity within limited inference budgets.</p>

          <p>I have read a lot of news and articles, and watched a few interviews regarding AI safety these days. The future of AI is promising. People are working towards more powerful AI and personalized AI assistants or agents. At the same time, AI causes problems. A very obvious downside of AI is people could use AI to do harmful things, but I think we are good to work together and prevent that from different angles such as legal aspect or open source software. I worry more about things that are not easily avoided and cannot be seen at least in these years when AI is still immature - which is being too early to rely on AI and thus deviating from truth. For example, it is too soon for us to lose faith in jobs like teachers, historians, journalists, writers, etc, but I’m concerning we are already losing faith in those jobs because of the development of AI and some violations of copyrighted work. As we have seen that AI could have wrong understanding of facts, have biased opinions, and make things up that don’t exist, we lives could fight for the truth but the dead cannot speak for themselves. It would be pathetic if human live in hallucination in the future, and I don’t know if there’s any good practice to prevent it. It’s like Pandora’s box is opened and complications cannot be stopped. But we should at least think seriously about the potential impact of AI on society and human consciousness and possible unexpected consequences.</p>

<p>Sometimes people who are doing hard data work may forget to step back and look at the big picture. This is a common mistake because we can definitely go from scientific data analysis to actionable insight for making better business decision. But we need to have some additional thoughts about whether the decision is a global optima or it’s just local due to the limited sample, restricted project goal, or restricted team scope.</p>

<p><em>When I decided to end my voluntary immersion in the driver community, I could not shake the feeling that the depersonalization of app workers is a feature, not a bug, of an economic model born of and emboldened by transformations that are underway across the global economy. This includes increasingly prevalent work arrangements characterized by weak employer-worker relations (independent contracting), strong reliance on technology (algorithmic management, platform-mediated communication), and social isolation (no coworkers and limited customer interactions).</em></p>
<p><em>As forces continue to erode traditional forms of identity support, meaningful selfdefinition at work will increasingly rely on how we collectively use and misuse innovative technologies and business models.</em><br><em>For example, how can companies deploy algorithmic management in a way that doesn’t threaten and depersonalize workers? How can focusing on the narratives that underlie and animate identities help workers reimagine what they really want and deserve out of a career coming out of the pandemic and the Great Resignation? Will increasingly immersive and realistic digital environments like the metaverse function as identity playgrounds for workers in the future? How will Web3 broadly, and the emergence of novel forms of organizing specifically (e.g., decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs), affect the careers, connections, and causes that are so important to workers? What role can social media platforms, online discussion forums, and other types of virtual water coolers play in helping independent workers craft and sustain a desirable work identity? In short, how can we retain the human element in the face of increasingly shrewd resource management tactics?”</em></p>

<p>This reminds me that last year when I was on vacation in LA, I’ve talked to a driver worked for both Lyft and Uber in LA. He complained Lyft’s route recommendation algorithm is shitty, not helpful at all, a waste of time, while Uber is better in comparison. At that time I realized how important it is to strengthen employer worker relations and gather feedback from workers or clients on the product improvement.<br>This is a great article where the author raises his concerns of dehumanization of workers in the future. While technology is advancing and economy is transforming, we don’t expect people to forget who they are in their daily basis work.</p>

<p><em>Musk has spelled out some of his prior logic in a set of “Master Plans,” but most of the logical basis for exactly how he will succeed remains ambiguous.

The thing is, over the last decade, the technological landscape has changed, and how and when to moderate speech has become a critical problem-and an existential problem for social media companies.

<p>This is a great article which profiles Elon Musk specifically in his strategies and vision. It answered my question confusing me for two years: what was Musk thinking on buying Twitter? The answer is: Musk’s vision is not in pursuit of a specific type of solution but is in pursuit of a specific type of problem. If we go back to 2016, Igor as a CEO of Disney decided not to buy Twitter because he looked at Twitter as the solution: a global distribution platform, while concerned the quality of speech on it is a problem. Musk was looking for challenges and complexities while Igor was preventing them and looking for solutions.</p>

<p>I watched Lex’s interview with Sam Altman uploaded on March 18, 2024, and an older interview with Ilya Sutskever happened 3 years ago. Elon’s lawsuit against OpenAI frustrated Sam but Sam is optimistic about the future and everything he is going to release in the next few months. Sam answered the questions “what does open mean in OpenAI” that ‘open’ mainly means putting powerful tech in the hands of people for free as a public good, but not necessarily mean open-source. He said there can be open-source models or closed-source models. About the transition between non-profit to capped for-profit, Sam said OpenAI is not setting a precedent for startup to mimic it but he suggested most startups should go for for-profit directly if they pursue profitability in the beginning.</p>
<p>Ilya’s interview is more interesting to me because he talked a lot about vision, tech, philosophy in Deep Learning. It’s impressive that he had such thoughts 3 years ago. </p>

<p>Nvidia also offers packages for companies such as DGX Superpod for DGX GB200 which combines 8 such GB200 NVL72. 8 GB200 NVL72 combined with xx becomes one GB200 NVL72 compute rack. And the AI factory or full data center in the future would consists about 56 GB200 NVL72 compute racks, which is in total around 32000 GPUs.</p>
<p>The Blackwell superchip will be 4 times faster and 25 times energy efficient than H100.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On March 14 (local time), during a meeting with the Korean Silicon Valley correspondent group, CEO Altman mentioned, “I am not sure when GPT-5 will be released, but it will make significant progress as a model taking a leap forward in advanced reasoning capabilities. There are many questions about whether there are any limits to GPT, but I can confidently say ‘no’.” He expressed confidence that if sufficient computing resources are invested, building AGI that surpasses human capabilities is entirely feasible.</p>

<p>Google DeepMind SIMA Team is working on the Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project. The goal is to develop an agent that follows instructions to complete tasks in any 3D environments. So far they are making progress on making AI agent understand the environment from computer screen, and use keyboard-and-mouse controls to interact with environment, follow language instructions, and play the video game to maximize the win-rate.</p>
<p>OpenAI has similar work called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openai.com/research/universe">OpenAI Universe</a>, which aims to train and validate AI agent on performing real world tasks. They started from video game environment as well. Although the goals of these two project sound similar, the minor difference is that OpenAI Universe intended to develop a platform where AI is able to interact with games, websites, and applications, while SIMA aims to develop an AI agent or maybe a robot to interact with the real world.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sora is the first video generation model, however it is not open-source. Lehigh University and Microsoft Research developed Mora to address the gap of no other video generation models to parallel with Sora in performance. Mora introduces an innovative multi-agent framework. As a result, Mora marks a considerable advancement in video generation from text prompts. The evaluation shows that Mora competes with Sora on most of the tasks, but not as refined as Sora in tasks such as changes in the video content, and video connectivity. </p>
