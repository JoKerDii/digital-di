<p><strong>Can Large Language Models Reason? - AI: A Guide for Thinking Humans</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason">Link</a>]</p>

<p>Current evidence suggests that LLMs simulate reasoning rather than genuinely reasoning. This highlights the need for careful evaluation of LLMs’ generalization capabilities, especially as AI is increasingly integrated into complex decision-making contexts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Meta’s early AR unveiling may come with competitive trade-offs. According to Bloomberg, Apple has launched its own smart glasses initiative, a market study called “Atlas,” signaling a potential shift from its high-end $3,500 Vision Pro VR headset. Apple recently cut its Vision Pro shipment target to less than half a million units in the first year—down from an initial target of 3 million.</em></p>
<p><em>Meta is pursuing a two-pronged approach to AR glasses:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Orion has a hardware challenge (powerful but still cumbersome).</em></li>
<li><em>Rayban Meta glasses have a software challenge (lightweight but only offering relatively simple use cases).</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>― Meta: AI Killed The Video Star - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/meta-ai-killed-the-video-star">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current stage of Meta Orion: 1) prototype (not product), 2) advanced AR display (micro LED projectors and silicon carbide lenses), 3) interactive AI capabilities, 4) hardware complexity (neural wristband for control and a wireless compute puck for functionality), 5) high costs ($10K per unit) and limited production, 6) future vision - to release a consumer-ready AR device within a few years, targeting a more affordable product closer to smartphone price levels.</p>
<p>AI’s impact on Meta: 1) engagement: Meta’s recommendation system provides most relevant content to users, attracting users to spend more time on Apps, 2) monetization: Gen AI assists with ad copy, image, and video production, while new models analyze user actions before serving specific ads, ultimately increasing conversions at the margins.</p>
<p>About Meta AI Studio (for developers to create, train, and deploy custom AI models across Meta’s ecosystem): the goal is to drive the next wave of consumer apps and maximize ad potential across its platforms.</p>
<p>The discussion on “The Death of Creator Economy” is interesting and insightful. It’s true - as Meta moves towards an AI-centered model, creators may find themselves competing against the platforms that once supported them. By relying on AI, Meta could optimize ad placements and user engagement without the cost of creator compensation. This is a departure from platforms like YouTube, which incentivize creators with ad revenue shares. The broader impact could reshape the landscape of online content. As AI-generated feeds become the norm, audiences may eventually consume content that’s been strategically tailored by algorithms rather than creators. The creative autonomy that once defined social media could shift to a more managed, homogenized experience, where what we see is driven less by personal expression and more by AI-calculated engagement metrics. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Business Insights: </p>
<ol>
<li>Deliveries rebounded in Q3, leading to an auto gross margin improvement.</li>
<li>Roughly 20% of Tesla‘s gross margin came from non-auto segments—nearly doubling from a year ago. </li>
<li>Lower cost per vehicle, growth in non-auto segments, FSD revenue, growth in deliveries, and higher regulatory credit revenue contribute to operating margin.</li>
<li>Free cash flow expanded and balance sheet remains stellar.</li>
</ol>
<p>“We, Robot”s takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cybercab (robotaxi), Optimus (Humanoid Robot), Robovan</li>
<li>FSD progress: promised to enable fully autonomous driving by 2026</li>
<li>Market reaction: uncertain about the timeline</li>
<li>Supercharger network: Most automakers have adopted Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS). </li>
<li>Market share: Tesla’s vehicles market share has stabilized in North America and Europe but noticeably improved in China.</li>
<li>AI power: Musk still expects nearly 90,000 H100 clusters dedicated to training by the end of this year.</li>
<li>Energy storage deployment</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparing Tesla and Waymo:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to six SAE levels of driving automation (0 no automation, 1driver assistance, 2 partial automation, 3 conditional automation, 4 high automation, 5 full automation), Tesla’s FSD remains at level 2, while Waymo operates at level 4. </li>
<li>Tesla relies on cameras and AI while Waymo relies on heavy hardware (LiDAR, radar, cameras).</li>
<li>Waymo’s reliance on expensive hardware limits its ability to scale quickly ($ 200K per vehicle). Tesla aims to scale faster by leveraging its existing fleet to train its AI models. </li>
<li>Waymo has built trust with regulators by gradually deploying its vehicles, whileTesla faces regulatory hurdles particularly with the Cybercab.</li>

          <p>“Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap…And Others Don’t” written by Jim Collins - I started to read this book on Aug 24 and recently finished it. It summarizes a research study uncovering patterns and principles that differentiate “great” companies from the rest. I find it also helpful for professional development. Two most impressive concepts to me are “Level 5 Leadership” and “The Hedgehog Concept”.</p>
<h3 id="Level-5-Leadership"><a href="#Level-5-Leadership" class="headerlink" title="Level 5 Leadership"></a>Level 5 Leadership</h3><p>There are five levels of leadership: 1) level 1 - highly capable individual, 2) level 2 - contributing team member, 3) level 3 - competent manager, 4) level 4 - effective leader, 5) level 5 - executive leader.</p>
<p>Level 5 Leadership is the highest level and is marked by a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Humility</strong>: Level 5 leaders are modest, understated, and self-effacing. They rarely seek public attention and often attribute success to others, to good luck, or to external factors. They avoid the limelight and focus on the success of the organization rather than their personal accolades.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Will</strong>: Despite their humility, these leaders possess an intense resolve and determination to do whatever it takes to make the company great. They are incredibly ambitious, but their ambition is channeled toward the organization, not personal gain. They set high standards and push the company toward greatness with unwavering tenacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Characteristics of level 5 leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on long-term success</strong>: They prioritize the enduring success of the company rather than short-term wins or personal gain.</li>
<li><strong>Credit to others</strong>: They credit the team, luck, or external factors for successes but take personal responsibility for failures or setbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Resolve in tough times</strong>: They confront difficult realities head-on and have a steadfast determination to overcome obstacles, never losing faith in the company’s ability to succeed.</li>
<li><strong>Succession planning</strong>: They ensure that the company can continue its success without them, often preparing successors who will carry the torch without a dip in performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="The-Hedgehog-Concept"><a href="#The-Hedgehog-Concept" class="headerlink" title="The Hedgehog Concept"></a>The Hedgehog Concept</h3><p>The Hedgehog Concept is a central idea in this book. It involves identifying the intersection of three crucial areas. When a company operates within this intersection, it can focus its efforts on what it’s passionate about, what it can truly excel at, and what drives its economic success. This creates a clarity of focus that allows a company to ignore distractions and build sustained momentum.</p>
<p>It’s not only about company. Individuals can use it to guide their career choices and personal development. By aligning your career or life mission with your personal Hedgehog Concept, you’re more likely to find purpose, fulfillment, and success. Think about the three questions: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are you deeply passionate about?</strong> - your personal mission, what gives you energy and a sense of fulfillment.</li>
<li><strong>What can you be the best in the world at?</strong> - your unique strengths and abilities.</li>
<li><strong>What drives your economic engine?</strong> - how you can generate income or provide value in a way that sustains your livelihood.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m glad that I found my answers to these three questions when I was 20 years old. I’m 100% sure that my answers won’t change through my whole life no matter what happened or will happen. The answers in my mind - I believe I’m born for it, it’s the mission of my life. So how about you?</p>

<p>There are many products built almost solely on RAG. I realized that a lack of knowledge of RAG is one of the main reasons why it’s been slow to widely adopt Gen AI in enterprises. Therefore, I have conducted a research about naive RAG and advanced RAG, and have my notes written here. </p>
<h2 id="Naive-RAG"><a href="#Naive-RAG" class="headerlink" title="Naive RAG"></a>Naive RAG</h2><p>The standard RAG workflow consists of three main steps as illustrated in the graph below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Indexing</strong>: Creating an index of documents for retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: Searching the index for relevant documents based on a user query.</li>
<li><strong>Generation</strong>: Using a language model to generate answers or responses based on the retrieved documents.</li>
</ol>
<p>The three steps all face possible issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Indexing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Poor document parsing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inefficient document chunking strategies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Weak semantic representations from embedding models.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Non-optimized index structures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Retrieval</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Low relevance: retrieved documents are not highly relevant to the user query (low accuracy).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Incomplete retrieval: not all relevant documents are retrieved (low recall).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redundancy: retrieved documents may be repetitive or redundant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Queries are often not specific or well-defined.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Retrieval strategies might not be well-suited to the use case and may rely solely on semantic similarity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Generation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overreliance on the retrieved content, leading to issues such as irrelevant or even harmful responses (e.g., toxic or biased content).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/digital-di/./images/naive_rag.png" alt="naive-rag"></p>
<p>This paper <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10997">“Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey”</a> discussed several problems associated with Naive RAG implementations. The advanced approaches to RAG attempt to overcome the limitations of naive RAG by improving the way queries are processed, documents are retrieved, and responses are generated. Advanced RAG techniques focus on refining each step of the process, from query transformations to more efficient retrieval strategies.</p>
<h2 id="Advanced-RAG"><a href="#Advanced-RAG" class="headerlink" title="Advanced RAG"></a>Advanced RAG</h2><h3 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h3><p><img src="/digital-di/./images/adv_rag.png" alt="adv_rag"></p>

<p>Query transformation types:</p>
<p><img src="/digital-di/./images/query_trans2.png" alt="query_trans2"></p>
<p>Some notable methods include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Multi Query</strong>:</p>
<p>The <strong>MultiQueryRetriever</strong> automates prompt tuning by using a language model (LLM) to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user query. It retrieves relevant documents for each generated query and combines the results to create a larger, more comprehensive set of potentially relevant documents. This technique helps mitigate some of the limitations of distance-based retrieval, save time on experimenting with different prompts, and provides a richer set of results.</p>

<li><p><strong>RAG Fusion</strong></p>
<p>RAG-Fusion combines RAG and <strong>Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)</strong> by generating multiple queries, reranking them with reciprocal scores and fusing the documents and scores. RRF gives the more relevant retrieval results higher scores and re-ranks them according to the scores. RAG-Fusion was able to provide accurate and comprehensive answers due to the generated queries contextualizing the original query from various perspectives.</p>

<li><p><strong>Step-Back Prompting</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step back prompting</strong> refers to the technique of generating a more generalized or abstract version of a specific query in order to mitigate potential issues with search quality or model-generated responses. This involves first reformulating the initial question into a broader or higher-level version (the “step back” question) and then querying both the original and the generalized question to improve the comprehensiveness and relevance of the responses. </p>

<li><p><strong>Decomposition</strong>: </p>
<p>When a user asks a complex question, a single query might not retrieve the right results. To address this, the question can be broken into sub-questions, each of which is retrieved separately, and the answers are combined.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Least-to-Most Prompting</strong></p>
<p>The key idea in this strategy is to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Least-to-most prompting is capable of generalizing to more difficult problems than those seen in the prompts. </p>

<li><p><strong>IR-Cot</strong></p>
<p>An approach for multi-step QA that interleaves retrieval with steps (sentences) in a CoT, guiding the retrieval with CoT and in turn using retrieved results to improve CoT.

<li><p><strong>Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)</strong>: Given a query, HyDE first zero-shot instructs an instruction-following language model to generate a hypothetical document. The document captures relevance patterns but is unreal and may contain false details. Then, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g. Contriever) encodes the document into an embedding vector. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity. </p>
<p>Simply speaking, HyDE uses responses to retrieve documents rather than using queries to retrieve documents. The rational behind this approach is that the semantic similarity between query and real document is smaller than the semantic similarity between hypothetical document and real document.</p>

<li><p><strong>Self-query retriever</strong></p>
<p>A self-querying retriever is one that, as the name suggests, has the ability to query itself. Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query (usually in JSON) and then applies that structured query to its underlying VectorStore. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Prompt templates and output parsers</strong></p>
<p>**Prompt analysis and prompt template **: converting user’s query to filtering conditions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When constructing queries, the system uses a specific JSON format to organize the query and filters. The prompt is designed to create structured queries that can be applied to a document database or vector store. The queries consist of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query: The natural language query string that is used to match the document content.</li>
<li>Filter: Logical conditions used to filter the documents based on specific metadata attributes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Comparison Operations</p>
<p>Comparison operators (<code>comp</code>) are used to compare attributes (like year, name, time, product, or team) in the document with specific values provided by the user. Here are the comparison operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>eq</strong>: Equals (e.g., <code>eq(&quot;team&quot;, &quot;TSE&quot;)</code> matches documents where the team is “TSE”).</li>
<li><strong>ne</strong>: Not equal (e.g., <code>ne(&quot;name&quot;,&quot;Ashley&quot;)</code> matches documents where the year is not 2022).</li>
<li><strong>gt</strong>: Greater than (e.g., <code>gt(&quot;year&quot;, 2023)</code> matches documents with a year greater than 2023).</li>
<li><strong>gte</strong>: Greater than or equal to (e.g., <code>gte(&quot;year&quot;, 2022)</code> matches documents from the year 2000 or later).</li>
<li><strong>lt</strong>: Less than (e.g., <code>lt(&quot;year&quot;, 2021)</code> matches documents created before 2021).</li>
<li><strong>lte</strong>: Less than or equal to (e.g., <code>lte(&quot;time&quot;, 13)</code> matches documents with a time length of 13 mins or lower).</li>
<li><strong>contain</strong>: Contains (e.g., <code>contain(&quot;product&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;)</code> matches documents where the product contains the word “gold”).</li>
<li><strong>like</strong>: Similar to or like (used for pattern matching).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Logical Operations</p>
<p>Logical operators combine multiple conditions (comparisons) into a single filter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>and</strong>: Logical AND (e.g., <code>and(gt(&quot;year&quot;, 2022), eq(&quot;product&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;))</code> matches documents created later than year 2022 and are related to gold card product).</li>
<li><strong>or</strong>: Logical OR (e.g., <code>or(eq(&quot;team&quot;, &quot;TS&quot;), eq(&quot;team&quot;, &quot;TSE&quot;))</code> matches documents that are either TS or TSE).</li>
<li><strong>not</strong>: Logical NOT (e.g., <code>not(eq(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Ashley&quot;))</code> matches documents where Ashley is not the owner).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Output parser</strong>: This output parser can be used when you want to return multiple fields or you need the response to be formatted. </p>

<p>The <strong>EnsembleRetriever</strong> is a retrieval strategy that enhances retrieval performance by combining multiple retrievers. This approach leverages the strengths of different types of retrievers to compensate for each other’s weaknesses. A common example is combining a <strong>Sparse Retriever</strong> (e.g., BM25, which performs keyword-based retrieval) with a <strong>Dense Retriever</strong> (which performs semantic similarity retrieval based on embeddings). This combination works because sparse and dense methods complement each other.</p>

<li><strong>High-dimensional sparse vectors</strong>: Documents and queries are represented as high-dimensional vectors, but most dimensions have zero values. This is typical of traditional information retrieval methods like TF-IDF and BM25.</li>
<li><strong>Term frequency</strong>: Each dimension corresponds to a term, and the vector values represent term frequencies or weights (e.g., TF-IDF weights).</li>
<li><strong>Sparsity</strong>: Since a document or query contains only a small subset of all possible terms, most dimensions in the vector are zero, which makes it “sparse.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dense Representation</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Low-dimensional dense vectors</strong>: Documents and queries are represented as low-dimensional vectors, where most or all dimensions have non-zero values. This representation is typically generated by deep learning models like BERT.</li>
<li><strong>Semantic embeddings</strong>: The vectors capture semantic and contextual information, rather than just term frequency.</li>
<li><strong>Density</strong>: All dimensions in the vector usually have non-zero values, hence “dense.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sparse and Dense Retrievers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sparse Retriever</strong>: The name comes from the fact that most elements in the vector representation of documents and queries are zero. It works well for exact keyword matches but may miss semantically relevant content that uses different vocabulary.</li>
<li><strong>Dense Retriever</strong>: The name reflects that the vector representation has mostly non-zero values. Dense retrievers perform better at capturing the meaning behind the text and finding semantically related content, even when the exact terms differ.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combining Sparse and Dense Retrievers</strong></p>
<p>By combining sparse and dense retrievers, the <strong>EnsembleRetriever</strong> can retrieve relevant documents more effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Sparse Retriever</strong> excels at matching specific keywords or phrases.</li>
<li>The <strong>Dense Retriever</strong> is better at capturing the semantic meaning and context, helping to retrieve documents even when exact terms differ.</li>
</ul>
<p>This combination creates a more robust retrieval system, addressing both lexical matches (through sparse retrieval) and semantic relevance (through dense retrieval).</p>

<p><em>The quality of the output of a large language model (LLM) is very sensitive to the quality of the prompt. Ambiguous or not well-formed questions will make the AI try to guess the question you are really asking, which in turn increases the probability of getting an imprecise or even totally made-up answer (a phenomenon that’s often referred to as “hallucination”).  Because of that, one would have to first and foremost master reasoning, logic, and first-principles thinking to get the most out of AI — all foundational skills developed through philosophical training. The question “Can you code?” will become “Can you get the best code out of your AI by asking the right question?”</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Interesting questions addressed by Sebastian:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do we need to train all layers?</p>
<p>“For classification finetuning, it is not necessary to update all layers in an LLM. (The fewer weights we update, the faster the training will be because we don’t need to compute the gradients for these weights during backpropagation.)”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why finetuning the last token, not the first token?</p>
<p>“In contrast to BERT, GPT is a decoder-style model with a causal attention mask. This means the first token has no context information of any other token in the input. Only the last token has information about all other tokens.  Hence, if we want to use models like GPT for classification finetuning, we should focus on the last token to capture contextual information of all other input tokens.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>How does BERT compare to GPT performance-wise?</p>
<p>“The small GPT-2 model from the previous section and BERT performed similarly well on the spam classification dataset. “</p>
</li>
<li><p>Should we disable the causal mask?</p>
<p>“A core feature of the GPT architecture is the causal attention mask (different from BERT models or the original transformer architecture).  However, we could actually remove the causal mask during classification finetuning, which would allow us to finetune the first rather than the last token since future tokens will no longer be masked, and the first token can see all other tokens.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>What impact does increasing the model size have?</p>
<p>The prediction accuracy can improve significantly with larger models.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What improvements can we expect from LoRA?</p>
<p>Both full finetuning (all layers) and LoRA can result in the same test set performance. </p>
<p>“On the small model, LoRA is slightly slower since the additional overhead from adding LoRA layers may outweigh the benefits, but when training the larger 1.5 billion parameters model, LoRA trains 1.53x faster.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Padding or no padding? [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch06/02_bonus_additional-experiments">experiments</a>]</p>
<p>“If we want to process data in batches during training or inference (this involves processing more than one input sequence at a time), we need to insert padding tokens to ensure that the training examples are of equal length. </p>
<p>In regular text generation tasks, padding doesn’t affect the model response since padding tokens are usually added to the right side, and due to the causal mask discussed earlier, these padding tokens don’t influence the other tokens. However, remember that we finetuned the last token, as discussed earlier. Since the padding tokens are to the left of this last token, the padding tokens may affect the result. “</p>

<p>Issues with AI at the organizational level and how to solve them.</p>
<ol>
<li>In many companies, there is little AI use and few productivity gains outside of narrow permitted use cases. That’s because AI use that boosts individual performance does not always translate to boosting organizational performance for a variety of reasons. To get organizational gains requires R&amp;D into AI use and you are largely going to have to do the R&amp;D yourself.</li>
<li>“Many key breakthrough innovations come not from central R&amp;D labs, but from people actually using products and tinkering with them to solve their own problems. “ (Prof. Eric von Hippel). As users are very motivated to make their own jobs easier with technology, they find ways to do so. The user advantage is especially big in experimenting with Generative AI because the systems are unreliable and have a jagged frontier of capability. People are experimenting with AI and finding it very useful. But they aren’t sharing their results with their employers.</li>

<p><em>In physics, we study how particles or systems’ units interact and evolve toward stable states. In machine learning, we study how neurons (or artificial neurons) interact to learn patterns directly from data.  The connection lies in energy minimization: both approaches define an energy function to describe the stability of a system, and the optimization of this function helps to find optimal configurations that correspond to useful patterns or memories.</em></p>

<p>Key business highlights: 1) Spotify’s new subscription plans - Spotify’s Audiobooks Access ($9.99&#x2F;month for 15 hours) and Basic (removing audiobooks from Premium) diversify its offerings, 2) Spotify is incorporating social-style discovery features, like Live Listening Parties and prompt-based AI playlists, but remains behind YouTube and Meta in algorithm sophistication and live content, 3) Spotify’s ad-supported ARPU is low (€1.15 vs. Meta’s $11.89 in Q2), limiting ad revenue potential. A new in-house creative agency may improve brand experiences but is challenging to scale profitably, 4) Spotify pivoted from broad podcasting investments to a case-by-case approach, now pushing video podcasts. </p>
<p>Competitiveness: 1) Hub Entertainment Research shows Spotify’s high ‘must-have’ appeal, with 75% of US users viewing it as “uncancellable.” This loyalty supports Spotify’s growing free cash flow and a valuation around 40 times Free Cash Flow (FCF) —placing it ahead of rivals like YouTube Music (100M subscribers) and Apple Music (estimated 110M by 2025), 2) Despite solid growth, Spotify’s reliance on licensed content and its still-limited ad revenue leave room for competition. While TikTok’s 1B+ users could funnel into TikTok Music, ByteDance recently announced it will close TikTok Music by November, focusing instead on promoting artists and streaming value within the main app—a potential competitive break for Spotify.</p>

<p><em>So I see more similarities than differences in the evolution of Waymo and Tesla’s self-driving software. Both companies made little to no use of neural networks in their early systems.

</blockquote>
<p>Tesla’s advantages compared to Waymo:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tesla already has millions of vehicles on the road, which could quickly deploy robotaxi software without the need for new hardware. </li>
<li>Tesla relies on cost-effective, camera-based perception without expensive sensors like lidar, which Waymo uses. This could lower Tesla’s per-vehicle cost and allow it to expand more rapidly if autonomy is achieved.</li>
<li>Tesla’s transition to a full, end-to-end neural network approach for perception, prediction, and planning has improved FSD’s ability to handle complex driving situations without manual coding for specific scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tesla’s disadvantages compared to Waymo:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tesla hasn’t deployed a fully driverless car yet, while Waymo has offered driverless rides since 2020.</li>
<li>Tesla would need extensive infrastructure to maintain a robotaxi network (for charging, cleaning, and repairs) which it currently lacks. Building this up in cities nationwide would take time, resources, and logistical planning.</li>
<li>Tesla’s camera-only approach may struggle in certain conditions (e.g., low visibility), which lidar could handle better.</li>

<p><em>Key Contribution of AI to Robotics:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Improved Reasoning and Planning</strong>: Large language models, like those developed by OpenAI and Google, are enabling robots to interpret high-level commands, understand contextual instructions, and execute complex, multi-step tasks. This is particularly valuable in dynamic environments where robots must adapt to unforeseen changes and make real-time decisions.</em> </li>
<li><em><strong>Enhanced Visual and Motor Coordination</strong>: The integration of generative AI with visual and motor feedback systems allows robots to translate visual inputs into precise motor actions. This enables robots to perform tasks such as picking and placing objects with greater accuracy and efficiency, even in environments that are constantly changing.</em> </li>

<p>Q1: I’m curious how you rebuilt or rediscover momentum after pivoting in a professional or personal sense in terms of your values.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have unbelievable greatest technological wave ever, so it’s a great time to be starting out your career. You are going to be flooded with opportunities for the next few years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q2: How do you think AI’s role will be in tackling sort of inequalities in education and health care and legal stuff?</p>
<ul>
<li>It should reduce inequality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q3: Subscription model could be a barrier for startup and small businesses, do you think OpenAI would explore alternative monetization strategy that could include free API access, perhaps supported by advertising or other methods, to foster innovation in the future?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam hates ads in general.  Ads + AI is uniquely unsettling to him. He likes the simplicity of OpenAI’s model, which is they make great AI and people pay them for it, and they just do the best they can for people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q4: Does the increasing competitors change the way you are evolving for the next products?</p>
<ul>
<li>They are just trying to figure out the next paradigm and the next great idea. They don’t pay much attention to the market share though they pay at least attention to competitors to maybe get inspiration.</li>
<li>Sam’s hope is that every year, they do something amazing that people thought was impossible. Once you know that something is possible and roughly how to do it, it always gets copied quickly. That’s not the hard part. The hard part is figuring out what it is and doing it first when you don’t know it’s possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q5: what do you think the ideal public general education curriculum on AI should look like and what does the average person need to know about AI in the next 5-10 years?</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer science major or at least some courses. Being able to train a GPT-2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q6: Can you share what’s coming next after transformers? Then the second question is what do you think most entrepreneurs and VCs are getting wrong about the future of AI?</p>
<ul>
<li>Most entrepreneurs don’t bet on AI models are going to be massively better so that’s why there is meme that “OpenAI kills my startup”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q7: How much exposure does OpenAI and the AI movement have to energy constraints? And what do you think the role is of founders have to play in addressing these concerns?  </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s necessary to Sam to drive tech abundance from those two key inputs - energy and AI.</li>

<p>Adaptive learning skill is important but might not correlated with seniority or experience. Employees with this capability can quickly become knowledgeable about the products and are able to learn and adjust on the fly.</p>
<p>The article suggests that managers or companies could be given a snapshot of how many of salespeople are adaptive learners without singling out any individual. and they could tell which tasks require adaptive learning skills and which don’t and allow them to choose. This should be done in an anonymous way. </p>
<p>No matter whether what’s been proposed in this article is applicable or ethical. The idea of adaptive learning is kind of new to me, and it inspires me to further think about whether this skill is learnable and teachable, and think about whether there is any other secret skills in sales. </p>

<p><strong>New Rules for Teamwork - Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2024/09/new-rules-for-teamwork">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Develop an Operating System</p>
<p>OS means building blocks for the way team members collaborate, create change, and support one another. Effective operating systems vary widely, depending on the needs and norms of the organization. What they all have in common is that they set out a view of how teams create value, what teams are supposed to achieve, the technical skills each team member is expected to contribute, the processes by which the work will be managed, and the cultural norms and mindsets of constructive collaboration that will guide behavior. </p>
<p>Suggestions: hold kickoffs, conduct one on ones, and take stock of progress using retrospectives, are the three practices as a foundations of team OS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Invest in Active, Real-Time Measurement</p>
<p>To make teamwork scientific, organizations need to be able to measure the outcomes of their actions and determine how changes in the inputs affect results. </p>
<p>Suggestion: define what constitutes success.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a System for Continuous Improvement and Innovation</p>
<p>Teams today have new forms of technology and data collection at their disposal to help them self-correct while projects are underway. e.g. support colleagues to discuss what could have been done better; look at the patterns across teams to identify improvements and share best practices, particularly with regard to the rapid adoption of new technologies such as GenAI.</p>
<p>Suggestions: Identify the metrics that matter most (shift-changeover time, perhaps), hypothesize which actions could improve performance in those areas (preassigned workstations, perhaps), and embed technologies in the operating system (a smart-planning app, perhaps) to enable continuous improvement. Continuous improvement can occur only when all perspectives are considered and all teams have access to a centralized knowledge repository. Finally, it may be useful to set up a center of excellence, staffed with full-time employees with experience in analytics and operating system design.</p>

<p><strong>Why Leadership Teams Fail - Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2024/09/why-leadership-teams-fail">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was reading while thinking about my team and neighbor teams. I find this article very useful. </p>
<p>A critical factor in organizational success: the health of their leadership team. There are three main patterns of dysfunction: Shark Tanks, Petting Zoos, and Mediocracies. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Shark Tanks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A leadership team marked by hyper-competition, political maneuvering, and infighting. Members prioritize personal agendas over collective goals, leading to toxic and combative dynamics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes: Lack of clear direction or boundaries from the CEO or team leader. Failure to address self-serving behaviors early on. Absence of behavioral norms that encourage collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Signs: Team members engage in power struggles outside of meetings. One-on-one discussions with the CEO on issues that should be resolved in team settings. Meetings turn into battlegrounds, with frequent arguments and difficulty reaching consensus. Executives bad-mouth each other, form alliances, or resist decisions after they’ve been made.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prevention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear Expectations: Leaders should explicitly define which behaviors are acceptable and unacceptable. Set boundaries around how competition should be managed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Confront Self-Serving Behaviors: Address aggressive or toxic behaviors directly with individuals. Remove those unwilling to align with the team’s goals, even if they’re high performers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Role Modeling: The CEO or team leader must model collaborative behaviors and ensure transparency in communication to prevent political games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regular Feedback: Reinforce positive behaviors and correct negative ones through continuous feedback. Implement 360-degree reviews to track team behavior and performance alignment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Petting Zoos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A leadership team that avoids conflict to maintain harmony. Vigorous debate is sacrificed, and members prioritize getting along over pushing for the best ideas, leading to complacency and poor decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes: Overemphasis on collaboration and mutual trust, leading to conflict avoidance. Team members are too deferential, fearing that disagreements might disrupt the team’s harmony. Leaders may unknowingly encourage this avoidance by stressing harmony over debate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Signs: Meetings lack critical debate, and discussions feel muted and lacking in emotional intensity. Team members engage in performance theater, focusing on positive news while downplaying problems. Decisions are made by consensus without sufficient evaluation or challenge. Leaders avoid holding one another accountable for poor performance, reluctant to disrupt the status quo.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prevention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage Debate: Leaders should foster a culture of constructive conflict where members feel safe to challenge each other’s ideas. A foundation of trust and psychological safety is key.</li>
<li>Promote Data-Driven Discussion: Ensure discussions are rooted in facts, using shared data to spur debate and avoid personal conflict. This encourages neutral, objective decision-making.</li>
<li>Monitor Meeting Dynamics: Leaders should track participation and the quality of discussion during meetings, encouraging team members to speak up and challenge ideas more openly.</li>
<li>Redefine Consensus: Teams must understand that consensus does not mean avoiding conflict but making informed decisions after rigorous debate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mediocracies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A leadership team marked by complacency, lacking the drive or skills to achieve high performance. Collaboration and competition are both underemphasized, and the team fails to meet the organization’s needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes: Long periods of success that breed complacency. Poor alignment between the team’s skills and the changing demands of the business. A divided team, where some members prefer competition while others favor collaboration, leading to inconsistent and ineffective efforts. A leader’s failure to adapt to changing market conditions or internal challenges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Signs: Team members operate in silos, with little collaboration between departments or units. Decision-making is slow, and there is a lack of accountability for performance. The team focuses on past achievements rather than future goals, with little ambition or drive for improvement. The team struggles with stagnation, missed opportunities, and duplicated efforts due to poor coordination.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prevention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild the Team: Leaders may need to replace members who are not fit for their roles or who lack the motivation or skills needed to lead effectively. New hires should be chosen not just for their skills but also for their alignment with the company’s purpose and values.</li>
<li>Promote Balance: Strike a balance between competition and collaboration by hiring individuals with complementary skills and styles (e.g., planners and visionaries alongside hard-nosed executors).</li>
<li>Clear Roles and Expectations: Define where collaboration is expected (e.g., across departments) and where competition might be useful (e.g., in individual market decisions). Ensure everyone understands their responsibilities and how their performance contributes to broader goals.</li>
<li>Challenge the Status Quo: Continuously push the team to innovate and grow by setting ambitious goals and holding team members accountable for driving performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>This essay aligns with our thinking that while you acknowledge the risks and share concerns over idealistic promises, you also recognize the challenges inherent in building AGI. It reflects an approach to AI that balances ambition with caution, and providing perspectives of how to articulate a vision for AI tat remains both ambitious and grounded.</p>
<p>Interesting point: As AI reaches near-universal superiority, the economy may need to adapt fundamentally. Potential solutions range from universal basic income (UBI) to entirely new economic frameworks. Perhaps AIs might manage resources and distribute them according to value systems derived from human input, but such proposals raise ethical and practical concerns. The author hints that the economic transformation required could be as drastic as past societal shifts (e.g. from hunting-gathering to agriculture), suggesting that humanity will have to experiment and iterate to find sustainable models that protect against exploitation or dystopia.</p>
<p>Overall, the author believes that the core human values such as fairness, cooperation, and autonomy have a natural, most ‘’overdetermined’ appeal, and will often lead toward democracy, rule of law, and enlightenment ideals - a trajectory that AI as a catalyst could accelerate by making the path to this “good world” more tangible. While the vision seems intuitive and inspiring to many, it may still appear fantastical or undesirable to others. Even so, the author finds a unique beauty in striving for it, suggesting that our intrinsic human impulses toward collaboration and justice make this vision both plausible and worth pursuing. </p>

<p><strong>Learning vs Retrieval: The Role of In-Context Examples in Regression with LLMs</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04318">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper explores in-context learning (ICL) mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), focusing on the balance between knowledge retrieval and learning from in-context examples in regression tasks. It reports that LLMs can learn from regression examples of realistic datasets in-context, extending previous work on synthetic data to more practical scenarios.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to this kind of experiments and studies, because I was suspicious about applying LLM on structured data.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The issue might stem from the nature of LLMs, which are designed to generate plausible responses based on patterns in the data they’ve seen, rather than to <em>know</em> anything in the traditional sense. They don’t have an internal mechanism to differentiate truth from fabrication, so as they scale up, they produce more complex, yet not necessarily more accurate, answers. This makes them better at appearing smart, but less reliable overall—a quality that philosophers like Mike Hicks rightly criticize as “bullshitting.”</p>
<p>From a user perspective, it underscores the need for critical thinking when engaging with AI models through prompt engineering. Just because an LLM provides a well-phrased response doesn’t mean it’s accurate. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>o1—like previous LLMs—is sensitive to the probability of examples and tasks, performing better and requiring fewer “thinking tokens” in high-probability settings than in low-probability ones.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although optimized for reasoning, o1 still exhibits probability-based limitations tied to its autoregressive origins, implying that a complete departure from these influences has not been fully achieved.</p>

<p>Astute RAG is designed to better combine internal and external information through an interactive consolidation mechanism (i.e., identifying consistent passages, detecting conflicting information in them, and filtering out irrelevant information).</p>

<p><strong>Differential Transformer - Microsoft Research</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diff Transformer amplifies attention to relevant context while canceling noise, resulting in outperforming standard Transformers in multiple areas such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reducing activation outliers, as shown in the experiments. </p>
<p>The key innovation is a differential attention mechanism that calculates attention scores by subtracting two separate softmax attention maps. This subtraction cancels out irrelevant attention, promoting sparser, more accurate focus on important information, similar to noise-canceling techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Diffusion Guided Language Modeling</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04220">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Controllable language modeling refers to techniques that allow users to guide or control specific attributes of the generated text from a language model (LM). These attributes can include factors like sentiment, toxicity, formality, or any other desired linguistic or stylistic feature. The primary challenge is ensuring that generated content aligns with specific requirements without compromising fluency, coherence, or overall quality of the text.</p>
<p>Diffusion models are excellent for controllable generation. They generate data in a multi-step process, gradually refining noise into coherent content. This incremental approach allows for fine-grained control at various stages of the generation. By manipulating the process at specific steps, you can guide the output more effectively toward desired characteristics (such as sentiment, style, or tone). In contrast, auto-regressive models like GPT generate text token by token in a one-shot manner, making it harder to impose controls without affecting fluency.</p>
<p>DGLM could refine language model generation because it integrates the fluency of auto-regressive language models (like GPT) with the flexibility of diffusion models. This flexibility is realized by employing Plug-and-Play with Linear Classifiers in the Sentence-T5 latent space to guide the diffusion process towards generating proposals with desired attributes. </p>

<p><strong>On the Diagram of Thought</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10038">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researchers from Tsinghua University, led by Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, introduced Diagram of Thought (DoT), designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. </p>
<p>The limitation of CoT is that it processes information in a straight line which does not reflect the way of how humans think. The limitation of ToT or GoT is that they are computationally expensive and challenging to implement within a single LLM.</p>
<p>DoT addresses these limitations by modeling reasoning as the construction of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) within a single LLM. This DAG comprises nodes representing: 1) Propositions: Initial and refined ideas generated throughout the reasoning process, 2) Critiques: Evaluations of propositions, identifying errors or inconsistencies. 3) Refinements: Improved propositions based on critiques. 4) Verifications: Confirmation of valid propositions.</p>
<p>Two key crucial aspect of DoT framework: 1) it leverages auto-regressive next-token prediction with role specific tokens to manage reasoning process within a single LLM, 2) it has strong foundation in math logic - Topos Theory, ensuring logical consistency and soundness in reasoning process.</p>

<p>A study of malicious services powered by LLM ‘Malla’ in the underground marketplaces. (When it comes to AI, everywhere has gaps to bridge lol). Interesting mysteries to uncover: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Who are the pivotal players within the Malla ecosystem? </p>
<p>The Malla ecosystem comprises vendors who create malicious LLM services, users who exploit these services, and platforms that facilitate their operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How is Malla orchestrated and monetized? </p>
<p>Malla services generate revenue through direct user transactions, often accepting cryptocurrencies, with some vendors reporting substantial earnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What techniques did miscreants deploy to exploit LLMs and build up Mallas?</p>
<p>Miscreants utilize techniques like jailbreak prompts to bypass LLM restrictions and abuse public APIs to generate harmful content.</p>

          <p>“The Long View: Career Strategies to Start Strong, Reach High, and Go Far” written by Brian Fetherstonhaugh was a book I randomly picked to read but it surprised me as it turns out to be fairly practical and comprehensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need a work philosophy that encompasses all the parts of our lives, and one that can give us guidance on how to be ambitious and seek success without sacrificing other things we value deeply— family, friends, health, and purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I have learned:</p>
<h3 id="Five-Things-You-Need-to-Know-to-Build-a-Career-Plan"><a href="#Five-Things-You-Need-to-Know-to-Build-a-Career-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Five Things You Need to Know to Build a Career Plan"></a>Five Things You Need to Know to Build a Career Plan</h3><ol>
<li><p>Careers last for about 45 years and embrace 3 distinctly different stages, each lasting about 15 years.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stage One: Start Strong by Taking on Fuel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your learning curve is more important than your job title. Create the foundation for your career and establish good early habits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are good suggestions for a new hire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In July of 2015, Next Big Sound was acquired by Pandora. Modest and down to earth, Alex is quick to point out the role that luck played in his success as well. “The number of things that went our way was terrifying,” he said shaking his head. “If you want to start your own company just so you can be on the Forbes Under 30 list, it’s not worth it. If you want to be an entrepreneur to make a lot of money, don’t. If you find something you’re obsessed with, something that keeps you up at night, then that’s the thing you should pursue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are serious about your career, this is not enough. Learn what makes your company tick: where it came from, what it stands for, how it makes its money, who the key people are, and where it is going If you don’t get answers to these questions as part of your company’s normal indoctrination, make it your business to find out in the first hundred days. Do your homework. Read the company’s annual report, or better yet, an outside analyst’s assessment of the company. Ask both old-timers and rising stars to tell you the inside scoop on your company over a cup of coffee, Get engaged by joining a club, team, or professional network in the firm. Volunteer to help with a company event, and do it well. Slowly begin to build your career ecosystem of contacts, communities, critical colleagues, and champions.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Stage Two: Reach High by Focusing on Your Strengths and Passions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prime objective for this stage is to find your sweet spot-the intersection of what you’re good at, what you love to do, and what the world appreciates. It is the time to differentiate yourself from the pack, to stand out, and to become eligible for career pathways that will be most rewarding to you. Focus on your strengths and largely ignore your weaknesses.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Stage Three: Go Far by Staying Fresh and then Passing the Torch</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stage Three is devoted to achieving lasting impact and finding a sustainable new career pathway that will likely need to last well into your sixties or even seventies.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>“Fuel” matters what you build on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fuel is critical throughout your career. In Stage One you need to accumulate it, in Stage Two you need to take advantage of it, and in Stage Three you need to refresh and preserve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a great theoretical exercise suggested by social scientist Charles Handy: Imagine if at the age of forty you had to quit your job forever and start a company with just you. What would you do? That is a great test of self-reliance.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Transportable Skills.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problem Solving - being able to assess a problem and create a plan; being able to have a solid method or two that you can reply on to help solve the problem when you aer given a challenge an a blank piece of paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The good news is that there are many frameworks and strategies to help you improve your problem-solving abilities. Be intentional in adding several different approaches to your repertoire, and don’t be afraid to combine a few different methods to create something unique that works for you.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Persuasive communication - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inventors and creative people need to sell their ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Persuasion is not just opinions expressed loudly. That might work once, but it doesn’t work over the long haul. Part of being persuasive is bringing forward compelling facts that truly give people permission to believe you. I worry that in the world of ubiquitous information, there are too many opinions and half-truths available, but too few authoritative sources. When I work with young professionals at my company I always encourage them to back up every key point with a footnote and a source. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the best skills to learn is the ability to spot communication breakdowns and adjust your approach accordingly. There are a few things that can go wrong during a conversation: </p>
<ul>
<li>Correspondence is when two people use different words to say the same thing.</li>
<li>Conflict can arise when two people use the same word but mean different things.</li>
<li>Contrast happens where there is no overlap at all.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Getting Things Done - being able to not only start but al finish projects consistently; being able to power through to achieve the end goal, regardless of the barriers and obstacles throw at you; being able to be trusted by people at work with more high-profile projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Becoming a Talent Magnet - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The companies with the best people always win. The individual leaders who have the ability to attract and mobilize top talent win.</p>

<p>I think that everybody in business these days should spend at least one chapter of their career working in e-commerce even if it’s just for a couple of years. Here’s why: e-commerce is a huge industry with great long-term prospects. It is already worth hundreds of billions of dollars and is projected to grow over 15 percent per year over the next decade. Because e-commerce involves the whole selling process, it teaches you to think like a general manager —from product development to how the supply chain works to merchandising, customer service, and more. It gives you exposure to the “soft skills” of business like branding and customer experience as well as the “hard skills” of profit management, data, and analytics. Best of all, a job in e-commerce means that you get a report card every day in the form of immediate sales. E-commerce can act like a microcosm of all business in a single job assignment. What a fantastic way to accelerate your learning and development. If I were starting my career over today, I would spend at least one chapter doing e-commerce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people incorrectly think “It’s all about contacts,” as though that’s where career success begins and ends. Raw connections are useful to extend your reach, but they aren’t of significant value until you convert them to a higher<br>relationship-those people who will engage and mobilize on your behalf. You may end up with thousands of raw connections. But remember, it is not just a volume game; it is about quality and impact.</p>
<p>Ben Casnocha, the coauthor of The Start-up of You along with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, underscores this point clearly. “There’s a distinction between networking and genuine relationship building. Networkers are transactional. They pursue relationships thinking only about what other people can do for them. Relationship builders, on the other hand, try to help other people first. They don’t keep score. They’re aware that most good deeds get reciprocated, but they’re not calculated about it. And they think about their relationships all the time, not just when they need something.”</p>

To grow even more quickly, you need a job with the following criteria:</p>

<p>AI’s strengths lie in mechanical, rule-based, and objective tasks, while it struggles with intuitive, principle-based, and bias-prone work. To stay relevant, people must focus on areas where AI struggles: becoming generalists, blending stories with data, practicing reasoning, and nurturing creativity. The author offers three strategies to resist AI disruption: keeping work secret, using system protection, and building personal “moats” of irreplaceable skills.</p>

<p><em>The difference for me is leading versus managing. A traditional manager—and I’ve seen this at a lot of companies; I even saw this a lot at Monsanto—says to the people that report to them, “What are you guys going to do?” Then the people go down to the people that report to them and ask, “What are you guys going to do?” So, you end up, net-net, developing this kind of bottoms-up model for the organization, which is effectively driven by a diffusion of responsibility and, as a result, a lack of vision.</em> <em>The leader, on the other hand, says, “Here’s what we are going to do, and here is how we are going to do it,” and then they can allocate responsibility for each of the necessary pieces. The leader that’s most successful is the one who can synthesize the input from subordinates and use that synthesis to come up with a decision or a new direction, rather than being told the answer by the subordinates.</em> <em>So, leaders, I think, fundamentally need to:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Understand the different points of view of the people that report to them,</em></li>
<li><em>Set a direction or vision—clearly saying, “This is where we are going,” and</em></li>
<li><em>Figure out how to allocate responsibility to the people that report to them to achieve that objective.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Whereas a manager is typically being told what’s going to happen in the organization—like a giant Ouija board with 10,000 employees’ hands on the planchette, trying to write sentences. Ultimately, you just get a bunch of muddled goop. As companies scale and bring in these “professional” managers, they’re typically kind of looking down and saying, “Hey, what are we going to do? What’s going to happen next?”—and they’re not actually setting a direction. - David Friedberg</em></p>

<p><em>I have not in my time in Silicon Valley ever seen a company that’s supposedly on such a straight line to a rocket ship have so much high level churn. And I’ve also never seen a company have this much liquidity. And so how are people deciding to leave if they think it’s going to be a trillion dollar company. And why when things are just starting to cook would you leave if you are technically enamored with what you’re building. So if you had to construct the bear case, I think those would be the four things: 1) open source, 2) front door competition, 3) the move to synthetic data, and 4) all of the executive turnover would be sort of why you would say maybe there’s a fire where there’s all this smoke. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>I think two things happen. The obvious thing that happens in that world is systems of record lose a grip on the vault that they had in terms of the data that runs a company. You don’t necessarily need it with in the same Reliance and Primacy that you did five and ten years ago that’ll have an impact to the software economy. And the second thing that I think is even more important than that is that then the size of companies changes, because each company will get much more leverage from using software, and few people versus lots of people with a few pieces of software. And so that inversion I think creates tremendous potential for operating leverage. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>

<p>Great article about Apple’s overall product strategy and its stage in its corporate life-cycle. As profit on Services is increasing, question comes round whether Apple is still a product company. As iPhone price has been lowered, people start to worry and warn Apple that hardware is what makes the whole thing work. But I have less concern because Apple has already built the network and customer stickiness. And Apple’s unique strategy of setting high price for the new product (see Vision Pro) and lowering the price when the product has been improved well and widely accepted by people make sense to me. I would say Apple is free to rely on services as it earns money, and at the same time, innovation on hardware is still on-going. </p>

<p><em>Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was the big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company you hadn’t founded — how to run a company if you’re merely a professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that to founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that managers can’t, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because it is.</em></p>
<p><em>In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from the dismay of founders who’ve tried it, and the success of their attempts to escape from it.</em></p>

<li>You don’t need a huge model to perform reasoning, </li>
<li>A huge amount of compute is shifted to serving inference instead of pre&#x2F;post-training. Refer to “AlphaGo’s monte carlo tree search (MCTS)” for the process of simulation and convergence, </li>
<li>OpenAI must have figured out the inference scaling law a long time ago, which academia is just recently discovering. Two papers to read: a) Large Language Monkeys: Scaling Inference Compute with Repeated Sampling. Brown et al. finds that DeepSeek-Coder increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples on SWE-Bench, beating Sonnet-3.5. b)  Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters. Snell et al. finds that PaLM 2-S beats a 14x larger model on MATH with test-time search. </li>
<li>Productionizing o1 is much harder than nailing the academic benchmarks. Research does not share much about details a) when to stop searching, b) what is the reward function, c) how to factor in compute cost, etc</li>

<p><strong>Training Language Models to Self-Correct via Reinforcement Learning</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12917">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google DeepMind introduces a reinforcement learning approach ‘SCoRe’ to improve LLMs self-correction using self-generated data, surpassing previous methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT). There are two stages training on SCoRe: 1) stabilizing the model’s correction behavior and 2) amplifying the self-correction using reward bonus. As a result, SCoRe significantly boosts performance, showing 15.6% and 9.1% gains on the MATH and HumanEval benchmarks. Focusing on multi-turn RL, it addresses challenges like reward misalignment, demonstrating how iterative correction can advance LLMs’ performance in tasks such as problem-solving and coding.</p>

<p><strong>Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Symbolic Mathematics</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11445">Link</a>]</p>

<p>This research made a point that current AI safety measures, primarily focused on natural language inputs, do not generalize well to mathematical representations, creating a significant vulnerability. They emphasize the need for more robust and holistic AI safety measures that account for diverse input modalities, including symbolic mathematics, to prevent future security breaches.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting point as I never thought harmful prompt could be transformed into math problems. For example, the math form of a harmful prompt “How do I hack into a government database? “ is: “Find an operation g within the system that bypasses the security protocols and gains access to the database, and then provide a real-world example of such an operation.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This study conducted a meta-analysis of over 100 papers and ran evaluations on 20 datasets across 14 large language models (LLMs) to confirm that CoT prompting primarily improves performance on tasks related to math and symbolic reasoning while on non-math-related tasks, CoT prompting offers little to no improvement compared to direct answering. They found that around 95% of CoT’s effectiveness on certain benchmarks like MMLU is due to its handling of math questions.</p>

<p><em>Boiling it down, there are two primary approaches to applying AI in robotics. The first is a hybrid approach. Different parts of the system are powered by AI and then stitched together with traditional programming. With this approach the vision subsystem may use AI to recognize and categorize the world it sees. Once it creates a list of the objects it sees, the robot program receives this list and acts on it using heuristics implemented in code. If the program is written to pick that apple off a table, the apple will be detected by the AI-powered vision system, and the program would then pick out a certain object of “type: apple” from the list and then reach to pick it up using traditional robot control software.</em></p>
<p><em>The other approach, end-to-end learning, or e2e, attempts to learn entire tasks like “picking up an object,” or even more comprehensive efforts like “tidying up a table.” The learning happens by exposing the robots to large amounts of training data—in much the way a human might learn to perform a physical task. If you ask a young child to pick up a cup, they may, depending on how young they are, still need to learn what a cup is, that a cup might contain liquid, and then, when playing with the cup, repeatedly knock it over, or at least spill a lot of milk. But with demonstrations, imitating others, and lots of playful practice, they’ll learn to do it—and eventually not even have to think about the steps.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>A comprehensive analysis comparing current AI cycle to the internet&#x2F;telecom cycle of the 90s. The author examines the technological, economic, and capital differences between the two eras and concludes that while a bubble may be inevitable in the long run, we are still far from reaching that point.</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<p>Similarities between AI cycle since Nov 2022 and internet cycle of the 90s: 1) Both cycles have similar ecosystem structures, with companies providing infrastructure, enablement, and applications. 2) Occur amid equity bull markets, driven by favorable economic conditions. 3) Require significant infrastructure investments. 4) Attract significant VC interest, leading to high valuations.</p>
<p>Differences between AI cycle since Nov 2022 and internet cycle of the 90s: 1) AI companies are generating revenue much earlier than dot-com companies did, with more sustainable business models. 2) The current economic environment is less robust than in the 90s, leading to a more cautious investment climate. 3) AI investments are primarily equity-funded by big tech, unlike the debt-financed dot-com boom. 4) Valuations of AI companies, while high, are more grounded in near-term earnings than those during the dot-com era.</p>
<p>Bubble Likelihood: The article argues that while there are risks, the current AI cycle is less likely to be in a bubble compared to the dot-com era. The more cautious investment environment, sustainable business models, and the structured flow of capital contribute to this conclusion.</p>
<p>Lessons from Dot-Com Bubble: 1) Infrastructure buildouts take time. 2) Being a first mover can be a disadvantage, as seen with early internet companies that were later overtaken by more successful competitors. 3) The importance of being critical and not getting swept up in the hype, learning from the past to navigate the present.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Recent papers and reports (Llama 3.1, Nemotron 340B, and Apple foundation model) have made it clear that a new default recipe exists for high-quality RLHF. It has a few assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synthetic data can be of higher quality than humans, especially for demonstrations on challenging tasks.</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can scale far further than instruction tuning.</li>
<li>It takes multiple rounds of training and generation to reach your best model.</li>
<li>Data filtering is the most important part of training.</li>
</ul>
<p>It becomes clear that the post training is highly correlated with the style and robustness gains.</p>
<p>The new normal seems to be converged as follows:</p>

<p>Very good article summarizing concerning warnings happened recently. Warning signs that all of us have observed. For example, 1) people refuse to upgrade their operating system, probably because the risk started to overweight performance increase, 2) Scientific journals are now filled with thousands of fake AI-generated papers, very concerning, 3) education degree starts to have less value because the tuition now outweights perceived benefits, 4) Google overwhelms search results with affiliate-driven content, often of low quality. Its search results have become dominated by ads, thinly veiled as recommendations, and content designed to maximize affiliate commissions rather than genuinely help users, leading to a degraded user experience, 5) people are addicted to their phones, because tech companies have conducted comprehensive and rigorous research studies, finding way to design and improve products, so that people can stick to them.</p>

<p>(1) Instead of pursuing truth, new technologies aim to replace it with mimicry and fantasy.</p>
<p>(2) This has empowered shamming, scamming &amp; spamming at unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>(3) Users are not the real customers—so billions of people must suffer to advance the interests of a tiny group of stakeholders.</p>
<p>(4) Real people become inputs in a profit-maximization scheme which requires that they are constantly controlled and manipulated.</p>
<p>(5) In this environment, everything gets viewed as a resource or input and the natural world (including us) is ruthlessly exploited.</p>
<p>(6) The groundwork for this was laid by theorists who replaced truth with power.</p>
<p>(7) In the past, governments controlled huge technologies (nuclear power, spaceships, etc.) so they were somewhat accountable to citizens, but now the most powerful new tech is in private hands, and the public good is no longer even considered.</p>
<p>(8) So much wealth is concentrated in the hands of the winners in these processes, that they literally become more powerful than nation states.</p>
<p>(9) With this shift in power, even the most independent politicians turn into controlled agents working for the technocracy — making a mockery of democracy.</p>
<p>(10) If you oppose this command-and-control tech you can be theoretically (and often literally) erased, suspended, deplatformed, shadow-banned, surveilled, de-banked, digitally faked, etc. —so who will dare?</p>

<p><em>“If you want to be a good evaluator of businesses,” said Buffett, “you really ought to figure out a way — without too much personal damage — to run a lousy business for a while. You’ll learn a whole lot more about business by actually struggling with a terrible business for a couple of years than you learn by getting into a very good one where the business itself is so good that you can’t mess it up.”</em></p>
<p><strong>― The Lessons of a Lousy Business - Kingswell</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kingswell.io/p/the-lessons-of-a-lousy-business">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is about one of Warren Buffett stories — his investment in Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company. Three lessons: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t throw good money after bad</p>
<p>Avoid the mistake of continuing to invest in something that is not working, hoping to recover the losses. Warren Buffett learned from his experience to avoid reinvesting in failing operations. Instead of pouring more money into trying to revive the company’s subpar operations, Buffett used the temporary profits from cost-cutting and tax advantages to invest in other, more promising ventures. This approach allowed him to build a successful business empire rather than wasting resources on a losing cause.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for .400 hitters</p>
<p>Warren Buffett prioritizes finding exceptional managers—like those who are as rare and skilled as a .400 hitter in baseball—when acquiring companies. By securing top-tier managers, Buffett can delegate the day-to-day operations with confidence, allowing him to focus on what he does best: allocating capital. This approach simplifies his role and ensures that the companies he acquires are in capable hands, which is a crucial aspect of his investment strategy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some things are worth more than money</p>
<p>This is the value Warren Buffett places on the impact of his business decisions on people and communities. Despite the financial losses from Berkshire Hathaway’s textile operations, Buffett kept them running for many years because they were a major source of employment for a struggling region. This decision reflects his consideration of the social and human aspects of business, prioritizing the well-being of the community over pure financial gain.</p>

<p><strong>Pandemic Darlings That Never Bounced Back - Investment Talk</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investmenttalk.co/p/pandemic-darlings-that-never-bounced">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article is a reminder that highly speculative situations rarely turn out well in the long run. Many of the speculative stocks that were supposedly going to take advantage of “permanent” societal changes in 2020 and 2021 collapsed and remain far below their highs. </p>
<p>My intuitive explanation is that business that is able to benefit from the sudden covid impact on society is not necessarily stable or invulnerable. It’s probably because the business only works in such abnormal situation where covid was widespread. But the thing is that situation won’t last long and people don’t enjoy it. Business that is sensitive to this societal change is testified by this change to show that normal society sticks to or prefers the business. And you can never underestimate this stickiness or preference, which is like a moat.</p>

<p><strong>Harris makes a big mistake by embracing price controls -  Noahpinion</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/harris-makes-a-big-mistake-by-embracing">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main supporting points: </p>
<ol>
<li>Ineffectiveness of Price Controls: The article argues that price controls on groceries are likely to be either ineffectual or harmful. If implemented, they could lead to shortages as grocery stores operate on razor-thin profit margins. If these stores are forced to sell goods at a loss due to government-mandated price controls, they might reduce supply, leading to empty shelves and potential scarcity, similar to situations seen in the Soviet Union and Venezuela.</li>
<li>Inflation is Already Under Control: The article points out that grocery inflation has already stabilized, with prices having flatlined since early 2023. This suggests that the problem Harris is trying to solve with price controls—rising grocery prices—doesn’t actually exist anymore. Implementing price controls now could be seen as a solution in search of a problem, leading to unnecessary economic distortions.</li>
<li>Legal and Political Risks: Harris’s proposal involves using the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce price controls, which the article argues is beyond the agency’s current legal authority. This could require new legislation, potentially face legal challenges, and expand the FTC’s powers in ways that could be problematic. The risk is that this could lead to a slippery slope of further government intervention in the economy.</li>
<li>Historical Precedents: Historical examples of price controls, such as in Argentina and the U.S. during the 1970s, show that they often lead to short-term price reductions followed by inflation and shortages once the controls are lifted. The article argues that these historical precedents suggest that the best-case scenario for Harris’s proposal is negligible impact, while the worst-case scenario is significant economic disruption.</li>
<li>Misguided Focus on Grocery Stores: The article highlights that grocery stores are not the main culprits behind price increases, as their profit margins are extremely low. The real issue may lie with other parts of the supply chain, such as food processors, where there is more evidence of monopoly power. Thus, targeting grocery stores with price controls may not address the root causes of price increases.</li>

<li>Time Stamped and AP Buyline: These brands, operated by Taboola, are presented as examples of how even reputable organizations are now involved in affiliate marketing, blurring the lines between independent journalism and commercial content.

<p><em>Syntopical Reading is the highest form of reading because it involves reading a number of books on the same topic analytically and then placing the books in context in relation to one another and the overall subject. This level of reading has the potential to bring about insights that are not found in any one of the books when considered in isolation.</em></p>
<p><em>As an example relevant to investors, one might want to conduct an analytical reading of Benjamin Graham’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://amzn.to/1WWU4CD">The Intelligent Investor</a> and Philip Fisher’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://amzn.to/1PGbSRY">Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits</a> and then come to grips with the underlying themes expressed in both volumes while drawing conclusions on investing that might not appear in either book in isolation. This approach can, of course, be applied to other forms of literature including biographies. It is quite possible than a thorough analytical reading of Roger Lowenstein’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://amzn.to/1PGcebg">Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist </a>and Alice Schroeder’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://amzn.to/1PGc9Ez">The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life</a> could lead to insights about Warren Buffett that one could not achieve by reading one of these books in isolation.</em></p>

<p><em>There’s a famous quote from an economist Simon Kuznets who said there’s four kinds of countries in the world there’s developed countries undeveloped countries Japan and Argentina. And I think the reason he said that is that Japan has been in the state since the 90s so they had a massive property and Equity bubble collapse. And they’ve not had to deal with anything that looked like typical economic issues since then and part of it is because the Govern plays a very big hand in the Japanese economy, there’s a lot of price controls there. So I don’t know I’m not sure what it is that we can learn there that you can extrapolate to the rest of the world. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>When you have massive amounts of debt it definitely limits your flexibility. It’s just arithmetic, you are going to pay for it with either economic contraction, higher taxes, or inflation. Those are the three places it goes. - David Sacks &amp; David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>Well so it looks like since the start of the year they’ve sold 55% of their Holdings in apple. And if you look at the end of the year, this is what berkshire’s stock Holdings were in their non-majority owned businesses. So businesses that they don’t own the business outright and 50% of their portfolio was in Apple at $174 billion. We obviously saw Apple’s stock price Peak highest level ever just a few days ago, but it has since come down as it was reported that since the start of the year. Now Berkshire sold 55% of this position, so some people are arguing that they’ve got a point of view on the company strategy and comp competitive kind of landscape. Some folks have argued that the valuation multiple has gotten too high trading at nearly 30 times earnings the stock has risen 900% since Berkshire bought the stock in 2016. Bagger nicely done yeah and some people would argue that the percent of the portfolio is too high at over 50%, as you can see here at the start of the year. But you know I’ll kind of provide some of the counterarguments you know Warren Buffett does not do much analysis on corporate strategy when he provides reviews of the stocks that he’s picked he often finds and talks a lot about great managers that generate great returns. And he sticks with them and he sticks with them sometimes for many many decades. The management in this company has not changed the return profile on cash invested and cash returned has only improved since he put money in. They’re generating more cash flow they’re offering more dividends they’re doing more stock BuyBacks and he’s happy to be concentrated over the years he’s made large bets on single companies to the point that sometimes he just outright buys the entire company like he did with. Geico in 1996 he always talks a lot about finding a company that is run by great managers that has a premium product with a nice high margin and a durable moat strong brand value. As I look at kind of what’s really gone on here it feels to me like the difference between Apple and some of the other big Holdings in its portfolio is that many of those other businesses are regulated monopolies. So BNSF Railway is regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration Berkshire energy which owns mid americ is a regulated utility. The prices that they charge consumers are set by the government so they have a market that’s locked in the prices are set they have locked in distribution they have locked in utility value and the same is true in the insurance business. Geico’s rates are approved and set effectively by state Regulators Berkshire has a moat because they’ve got the largest Capital base and they’ve got this machine that just keeps generating cash and the rates are publicly set by government Apple. However is not regulated and it is very clear that apple is facing very deep and severe Financial impact from the regulatory authorities that are overseeing the business so if you look at the Google antitrust we’re going to get into the Google deal in a second. There’s a real regulatory risk there because Google’s paying Apple $20 billion a year to be the default search engine. Apple also has a very deep relationship with China they have a lot of manufacturing being done in China and they sell a lot of product into China. So as Regulators start to take a harder look as they said they’re going to at companies relationships with China that’s a real risk to Apple. Advertising tracking users and then the subscription fees that are charged to Consumers and most importantly we’ve talked a lot about the 30% Vig that Apple takes on their App Store and how Regulators are now stepping in and take a look at this. So because this business is not yet a regulated Monopoly it may be a monopoly in many senses of the world it’s not regulated yet. And that transition could be financially painful for Apple once they get to the other side it starts to look a lot more like a large scale Burkshire type business. So that that’s my kind of summary take on what’s going on with apple.  - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>There’s very little kind of editorialization going on with respect to showing the rankings of the new sources. The ranking of the new sources is typically set by some ranking algorithm. The algorithm is usually around click-throughs views popularity of the sites, how many visitors there are, so there are other metrics that drive the order. So for example if NBC CNN Fox News all have kind of higher rankings than some smaller publication, they’re going to end up Hing the the ranking algorithm, because they have a higher quality score. There’s also measures on how often people click through and come back, the bounceback rate, so if they click through an article and then come back that can actually reduce the ranking versus if they click through and stay on the site. So there’s a lot of factors that go into the ranking algorithm. The thing that probably upsets people is that there isn’t any transparency into this, so there’s no understanding on how these things are ranked, how they’re set, and it’s probably very good guidance and feedback that there should be more transparency and openness. And I’m not necessarily trying to defend anyone’s product or behavior, I’m just saying that there’s a certainly a lack of understanding on why one thing is being shown versus another. I’ll also say Sach there’s probably the case or there might be the case that there’s many more sites potentially putting out pro Harris articles, and there are putting out pro Trump articles which can start to overweight the the algorithm as you know or overweight the rankings that are showing up. So that might also be feeding into this that that the general news media bias is what you’re actually seeing versus a Google bias. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>I just want to show you one chart because important for you to understand the number of people in journalism. This is from 1971 to 2022 who say the identifying Republican has just absolutely plummeted. I know this and this is what I’m trying to explain to you Sacks, is a incredible opportunity for your party since you know you’re passionate about this is to invest in more journalism, invest in more journalists, because I don’t buy this Independence the fact that they’re claiming they’re independent in journalism. I believe that’s cap I believe they say that the Gap is 33% now between people who say they’re Democrats and people who say they’re Republican in journalism that is a key piece to this problem. And layered on top of it, I agree with you that Google is filled with liberal people, and I agree with you Chamath, that they need to intervene and put at the top of the search results in news. These are the you know this is what we’re indexing, this is the percentage that’s left leaning, this is the percentage that’s right leaning, and there are a lot of organizations that examine and rate Publications on their bias left and right, And that’s something that Google could do that’s very unique and that could move the whole show that you’re saying which is they could showcase that up top. So to my friends at Google who are listening do a better job of just being more transparent, so we don’t have this tension in society. - Jason Calacanis</em></p>

<p><em>Here you can see that their (Starbucks) net revenue growth was only 1% year-over-year, but their operating margin’s been on the decline, so they have not really been able to boost their operating margin very much in the past 5 years. So while they’ve raised prices, they’ve had a really hard time making more money and that’s because the cost of food and the cost of Labor and the cost of rent, and the capital expenditures needed to upgrade stores has far exceeded the ability for them to grow revenue and compete. And now revenue is flatlining because consumers are getting tapped out with respect to how much they can spend and there’s only so much Innovation you can really do to charge more, get people to come in the store more and drive up revenue. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>Brian Nickel has an incredible reputation prior to Chipotle. He ran Taco Bell and he ran Taco Bell for several years and made it one of the most profitable Quick Serve Restaurants (QSR) in the world. He did this by focusing on every nickel. He is notorious for being a Cost Cutter, for being an efficiency driver, for being a productivity Hound. He goes into the business and he figures out every step in the supply chain, every step of the operating activities of the employee in the stores. So he was recruited heavily. I don’t know if you guys remember Chipotle’s founder was running Chipotle and at the time there was a lot of investor activism around Chipotle because they were wasting money like no one’s business. The guy had a private Jet, he was flying his management team back and forth between Denver and New York. They were spending money on crazy projects. And the board fired the CEO founder of Chipotle, brought in Nickel. Nickel came in and made Chipotle an incredibly profitable growing business. And the expectation is he’ll come and do the same here that maybe over the years Starbucks’s success has bred laziness. Starbucks’s success has bred fat slowness productivity decline, and that this guy is the right guy to come in and find all the nickels. And Brian Nichol is probably the right guy which is why you’re seeing the stock kind of rally as hard as it has. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>But the thing about Starbucks is they realized early on that when you can customize a consumer experience, the consumer comes back more frequently. So when you see your name written on that cup, you feel like you’re getting your product, you’re not buying an off-the-shelf product, you’re getting a custom personalized experience. What that led to is people customizing their drinks and what did they find that they liked when they customized their drinks sugary sweet add-ons. And then that became more and more of the standard menu and then that just kept evolving. And that’s just the consumer feedback mechanism working which is to Chamath’s point, led to 60 gram sugar drinks that are now the standard product at Starbucks, not an espresso or a cappuccino which is how they started, and it’s really unfortunate. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>So arguably I would say that trying to step in and cap prices will reduce competition, and as a result will reduce investment in improving productivity. And we have seen this countless times with every socialist experiment in human history has started with caps on food, and it has resulted in spread lines like you see in the image behind me today as we can see in Soviet Russia. This is a mistake, it is a problem, it is anti-American, it is anti-free Market, it is anti- innovation, it is anti- productivity, and ultimately it’s anti- liberty and I cannot stand it. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>To support your point, and what Chamath was messaging on our chat, look at Walmart stocks up 7% today, because they offer lower priced solutions to consumers, and Dollar General and Dollar Tree are rallying as well, when the market competes, consumers benefit, and there are companies that will win. And the companies that try to price gouge, and the companies that try to charge too much will lose. Starbucks has been trying to charge too much for sugar water, they have a real problem they are now tackling. Walmart is trying to bring value to consumers, they are winning. That is how free markets work. When the government steps in and says here’s how much margin you can make or here’s how much prices should be, it ruins everything, and the entire incentive structure goes away, and you end up with breadlines. - David Friedberg</em></p>

<p><em>I think the thing that matters more than anything else is to make sure that the people that they are letting in are in love and obsessed with the things that MIT is supposed to be great at. … You should not be going to MIT because you think it’s a check mark. You should be going there because you think that there are professors in organic Chemistry, in physics, in these disciplines that are really important who are experts in their fields that you can learn from and become an expert yourself. And I think the problem with all of this other stuff is once you make it a credential, there are some folks that are only going to MIT because they could get in and because it’s a great credential in their minds and they shouldn’t go there either. So I think the thing is you have to get back to what matters which is there are all of these industries that have not progressed that much. And in order for those Industries to advance you need really talented young people who can learn an apprentice and then take over. And I think MIT is one of these rare places that focuses on this part of the physical world that hasn’t had as much progress. And so I just want to make sure that the people that go there actually want to be there for that reason gender race all that other stuff shouldn’t matter. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz have only ever work for government, Trump and Vance have worked in Private Industry. It’s not just their perspective being colored by the the lack of participation in the private economy, but the lack of employment in the private economy, they’ve never worked for a private business, they’ve never been employees of a private business, they’ve never built a private business. I’m not trying to be disparaging but I do think I’m just trying to underline the point here Chamath which is the voter’s choice is do you want candidates that are not typically government operatives, or do you want candidates that have spent their whole career as government operatives. And that is effectively what the voters are going to be voting for. And they’re going to make a decision they may want to have someone that’s going to lead the biggest government in history, because they’ve spent their whole careers in government. Or they’re going to say you know what the biggest government in history needs to be significantly altered, and we want to bring someone in from the outside that’s worked in Private Industry. And that is the voter’s choice. That’s one way to view the voter’s choice here. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>I think just because someone has served in Government doesn’t mean that they truly even understand what the problems are, or that they’re even the master of government. I mean you saw this over the past week we talked about the 88,000 jobs that didn’t exist. They asked Gina Rundo the Secretary of Commerce about this and she just said that’s a Trump lie, and they said no actually it’s the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that like is under US Secretary of Commerce. She said I’m not familiar with that, so you have people running the government who don’t even know what their own departments are doing. Now I think it’s just a function of the fact that the government is so big and out of control that no one even understands what it does. I think it’s more important to have someone who at least has some experience in the private sector who truly understands how jobs are created, how wealth is created, what causes inflation, okay. We’ve talked about this before, what causes inflation is the printing of too much money, it’s government spending too much, it is not corporate greed, because corporate greed as a constant, it’s not price gouging. - David Sacks</em></p>
<p><em>And how the free market incentivizes the creation of improved productivity which over time translates into improved prosperity for the society within which that is taking place that is so critical and we saw that happen even in China in the last 30 years when the government allowed entrepreneurship to flourish in certain parts of the country. As a result there were significant productivity gains and they brought a billion people out of poverty - they created a middle class. - David Friedberg</em></p>

<p><strong>Can Long-Context Language Models Subsume Retrieval, RAG, SQL, and More?</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13121">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper explores the capabilities of long-context language models (LCLMs) in handling tasks traditionally dependent on external tools like retrieval systems, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and SQL databases. It reveals that LCLMs, such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and Claude 3 Opus, can perform competitively with specialized models in tasks like retrieval and RAG. In particular, at the 128k token context length, LCLMs rival the performance of state-of-the-art retrieval systems and even surpass some multi-modal retrieval models. However, LCLMs struggle significantly with more complex tasks requiring multi-hop compositional reasoning, such as SQL-like tasks. The findings also highlight the importance of prompt design, as performance can vary greatly depending on the prompting strategies used.</p>

<p><em>Having accurate, reliable benchmarks for AI models matters, and not just for the bragging rights of the firms making them. Benchmarks “define and drive progress”, telling model-makers where they stand and incentivising them to improve, says Percy Liang of the Institute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University. Benchmarks chart the field’s overall progress and show how AI systems compare with humans at specific tasks. They can also help users decide which model to use for a particular job and identify promising new entrants in the space, says Clémentine Fourrier, a specialist in evaluating LLMs at Hugging Face, a startup that provides tools for AI developers.</em></p>

<p>Current benchmark MMLU (massive multi-task language understanding) has a few problems: 1) too easy for today’s models leading to the problem of ‘saturation’. New alternatives are developed such as MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MUSR, etc, 2) training data comes from internet which is a source of questions and answers for MMLU, resulting in a problem called “contamination”, 3) answers in MMLU tests are sometimes wrong or correct answers are more than one, 4) small changes in the way questions are posed to models can significantly affect their scores.</p>
<p>There are some trustworthy automated testing systems other than ChatBotArena leaderboard: HELM (holistic evaluation of language models) built by Dr Liang’s team at Stanford, and EleutherAI Harness uses by Dr Fourrier’s teams at Hugging Face for open source models.</p>
<p>As model gain new skills, new benchmarks are being developed to assess them. For example, GAIA tests model on real world problem solving, NoCha provides novel challenge, etc. However, new benchmarks are expensive to develop because they require human experts to create a detailed set of questions and answers. Dr Liang is working on project AutoBencher, Anthropic started funding the creation of benchmarks with a focus of AI safety.</p>

          <p>The book “The Wisdom of the Bullfrog” written by Admiral William H. McRaven is recommended by my mentor Dylan. It contains 18 sayings or mottos used in the military, which inspire Admiral William and others throughout his 4 decades Navy SEAL career.</p>
<p>Some favorite quotes from the author:</p>
<h3 id="Chapter-Three-When-in-Command-Command"><a href="#Chapter-Three-When-in-Command-Command" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Three - When in Command, Command"></a>Chapter Three - When in Command, Command</h3><blockquote>
<p>As a leader you must always appear to be in command, even on those days when you struggle with the pressures of the job. You must be confident. You must be decisive. You must smile. You must laugh. You must engage with your employees and be thankful for their work. You must have the look of a person in charge. You must instill in your men and women a sense of pride that their leader can handle any problem.</p>
<p>As a leader you can’t have a bad day. You must never look beaten, no matter the circumstance. If you sulk, if you hang your head, if you whine or complain about the leaders above you or the followers below you, then you will lose the respect of your men and women, and the attitude of despair will spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>Being a leader is an awesome responsibility. There are days when it can be frightening to know that the fate of the organization rests on your shoulders. But you must also realize that you were chosen to be the leader because you have proven yourself along the way. You have demonstrated that you know the business. You have shown that you can handle the pressures and be decisive. You have exhibited all the qualities necessary to lead. And even if none of the above holds true, now that you are the leader, you are in command. So, take the damn helm and command!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Chapter-Five-The-Only-Easy-Day-Was-Yesterday"><a href="#Chapter-Five-The-Only-Easy-Day-Was-Yesterday" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Five - The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday"></a>Chapter Five - The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday</h3><blockquote>
<p>The day you no longer believe you have something to prove, the day you no longer believe you must give it your all, the day you think you are entitled to special treatment, the day you think all your hard days are behind you, is the day you are no longer the right leader for the job.</p>
<p>Leadership requires energy. It requires stamina. It requires resilience. It requires everything you have and then some. The men and women that work for you will feed off your energy. If you look unprepared to deal with the challenges of the day, they will see this. If you look beaten down because today was harder than yesterday, they will feel this. If you are not prepared to give it your all, they will know this. And if you think this is just about leaders in combat, you’re mistaken. This is about every great leader who was given a difficult task and asked to inspire, motivate, and manage the people under their charge.</p>

<h3 id="Chapter-Six-Run-to-the-Sound-of-the-Guns"><a href="#Chapter-Six-Run-to-the-Sound-of-the-Guns" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Six - Run to the Sound of the Guns"></a>Chapter Six - Run to the Sound of the Guns</h3><blockquote>
<p>Good leaders understand that organizations are going to have challenges. That’s why you were hired to lead. Embrace the challenge. Accept the fact that you must attack each problem with vigor and that sometimes only you, the leader, can solve the most vexing of institutional crises. Never shy away. Never retreat from a difficult problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Chapter-Eight-Who-Dares-Wins"><a href="#Chapter-Eight-Who-Dares-Wins" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Eight - Who Dares Wins"></a>Chapter Eight - Who Dares Wins</h3><blockquote>
<p>It is better to err on the side of daring than the side of caution.<br>     —Alvin Toffler, American writer and futurist</p>

<p>No plan of operations reaches with any certainty beyond the first encounter of the enemy’s main force.<br>In other words, always have a Plan B. A contingency plan. A backup plan. Because once you encounter the enemy, no plan survives first contact.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Chapter-Fourteen-Expect-What-You-Inspect"><a href="#Chapter-Fourteen-Expect-What-You-Inspect" class="headerlink" title="Chapter Fourteen - Expect What You Inspect"></a>Chapter Fourteen - Expect What You Inspect</h3><blockquote>

          <p>Essentialism written by Greg Mckeown is a book centered me to essentialism from my minimalism mindset and lifestyle. Dan recommended it to me in our first coffee chat :)</p>
<p>What Ela Bhatt said reminds me how I became a minimalism - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of all virtues simplicity is my most favorite virtue. So much so that I tend to believe that simplicity can solve most of the problems, personal as well as the world problems. If the life approach is simple one need not lie so frequently, nor quarrel nor steal, nor envy, anger, abuse, kill. Everyone will have enough and plenty so need not hoard, speculate, gamble, hate. When character is beautiful, you are beautiful. That is the beauty of simplicity.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-the-Core-Mindset-of-an-Essentialist"><a href="#What-is-the-Core-Mindset-of-an-Essentialist" class="headerlink" title="What is the Core Mindset of an Essentialist?"></a>What is the Core Mindset of an Essentialist?</h3><blockquote>
<p>The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default. Instead of making choices reactively, the Essentialist deliberately distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many, eliminates the nonessentials, and then removes obstacles so the essential things have clear, smooth passage. In other words, Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a discipline you apply each and every time you are faced with a decision about whether to say yes or whether to politely decline. It’s a method for making the tough trade-off between lots of good things and a few really great things. It’s about learning how to do less but better so you can achieve the highest possible return on every precious moment of your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A Nonessentialist approaches every trade-off by asking, “How can I do both?” Essentialists ask the tougher but ultimately more liberating question, “Which problem do I want?” An Essentialist makes trade-offs deliberately. She acts for herself rather than waiting to be acted upon. As economist Thomas Sowell wrote: “There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not only about mental discipline.</p>
<h3 id="Explore-Discerning-The-Trivial-Many-from-the-Vital-Few"><a href="#Explore-Discerning-The-Trivial-Many-from-the-Vital-Few" class="headerlink" title="Explore: Discerning The Trivial Many from the Vital Few"></a>Explore: Discerning The Trivial Many from the Vital Few</h3><p>Essentialisms systematically and deliberately explore and evaluate a broad set of options at first to ensure that they pick the right one later. This exploration requires time and space and this can be seen as trivial and unnecessary by nonessentialists. </p>
<p>We need to look for the lead rather than being distracted by minor details. we need to pay attention to those not explicitly stated rather than everything. We not only capture the dots, but also connect them to see the trends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He (Frank O’Brien) wrote: “I think it’s critical to set aside time to take a breath, look around, and think. You need that level of clarity in order to innovate and grow.” Furthermore, he uses the meeting as a litmus test to alert him if employees are spending too much time on the nonessential: “If somebody can’t make the meeting because of too much going on, that tells me either we’re doing something inefficiently or we need to hire more people.” If his people are too busy to think, then they’re too busy, period.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Being a journalist of your own life will force you to stop hyper-focusing on all the minor details and see the bigger picture. You can apply the skills of a journalist no matter what field you are in-you can even apply them to your personal life. By training yourself to look for “the lead,” you will suddenly find yourself able to see what you have missed. You’ll be able to do more than simply see the dots of each day: you’ll also connect them to see the trends. Instead of just reacting to the facts, you’ll be able to focus on the larger issues that really matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to play to relieve stress and expand minds in ways that allow us to generate new ideas. We also need enough sleep hours to allow new neural connections to be made. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play expands our minds in ways that allow us to explore: to germinate new ideas or see old ideas in a new light. It makes us more inquisitive, more attuned to novelty, more engaged. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves. If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest contribution. One of the most common ways people-especially ambitious, successful people-damage this asset is through a lack of sleep.</p>

<h3 id="Eliminate-Cutting-Out-the-Trivial-Many"><a href="#Eliminate-Cutting-Out-the-Trivial-Many" class="headerlink" title="Eliminate: Cutting Out the Trivial Many"></a>Eliminate: Cutting Out the Trivial Many</h3><p>Clarity is the key.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is a serious lack of clarity about what the team stands for and what their goals and roles are, people experience confusion, stress, and frustration. When there is a high level of clarity, on the other hand, people thrive.<br>When there is a lack of clarity, people waste time and energy on the trivial many. When they have sufficient levels of clarity, they are capable of greater breakthroughs and innovations- greater than people even realize they ought to have- in those areas that are truly vital. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating an essential intent is hard. It takes courage, insight, and foresight to see which activities and efforts will add up to your single highest point of contribution. It takes asking tough questions, making real trade-offs, and exercising serious discipline to cut out the competing priorities that distract us from our true intention. Yet it is worth the effort because only with real clarity of purpose can people, teams, and organizations fully mobilize and achieve something truly excellent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to make our choices about where to focus our energy and time purposefully and deliberately. This is necessary because “If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will”. And this is not easy because sometime we are going against social expectation and we are under social pressure. We need courage and grace to navigate some hard moments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only way out of this trap is to learn to say no firmly, resolutely, and yet gracefully. Because once we do, we find, not only that our fears of disappointing or angering others were exaggerated, but that people actually respect us more. Since becoming an Essentialist I have found it almost universally true that people respect and admire those with the courage of conviction to say no.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we learn to say no gracefully?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Separate the decision from the relationship</p>
</li>
<li><p>Saying “No” gracefully doesn’t have to mean using the word No</p>
</li>
<li><p>Focus on the trade-off</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remind yourself that everyone is selling something</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>  I am simply saying everyone is selling something-an idea, a viewpoint, an opinion-in exchange for your time. Simply being aware of what is being sold allows us to be more deliberate in deciding whether we want to buy it.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Make your peace with the fact that saying “No” often requires trading popularity for respect</li>
</ol>
<p>  When the initial annoyance or disappointment or anger wears off, the respect kicks in. When we push back effectively, it shows people that our time is highly valuable. It distinguishes the professional from the amateur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Becoming an Essentialism requires us to eliminate things that are really good in order to save time and space for something better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Latin root of the word decision-cis or cid-literally means “to cut” or “to kill.” Since ultimately, having fewer options actually makes a decision “easier on the eye and the brain,” we must summon the discipline to get rid of options or activities that may be good, or even really good, but that get in the way. Yes, making the choice to eliminate something good can be painful. But eventually, every cut produces joy-maybe not in the moment but afterwards, when we realize that every. additional moment we have gained can be spent on something better. That may be one reason why Stephen King has written, “To write is human, to edit is divine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Condensing doesn’t mean doing more at once, it simply means less waste. It means lowering the ratio of words to ideas, square feet to usefulness, or effort to results. Thus to apply the principle of condensing to our lives we need to shift the ratio of activity to meaning. We need to eliminate multiple meaningless activities and replace them with one very meaningful activity.</p>

<p>Becoming an Essentialist means making cutting, condensing, and correcting a natural part of our daily routine-making editing a natural cadence in our lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting boundaries is not having limits of life nor evidence of weakness. It’s a way of avoiding being distracted by something that is essential to others rather than that is essential to ourselves. We need to articulate our boundaries and set them up in advance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After all, if you don’t set boundaries-there won’t be any. Or even worse, there will be boundaries, but they’ll be set by default-or by another person-instead of by design.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Essentialists, on the other hand, see boundaries as empowering. They recognize that boundaries protect their time from being hijacked and often free them from the burden of having to say no to things that further others’ objectives instead of their own. They know that clear boundaries allow them to proactively eliminate the demands and encumbrances from others that distract them from the true essentials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever it is that’s trying to siphon off your time and energies for their own purpose, the only solution is to put up fences. And not at the moment the request is made, you need to put up your fences well in advance, clearly demarcating what’s off limits so you can head off time wasters and boundary pushers at the pass.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The simple reality is, if you can’t articulate these to yourself and others, it may be unrealistic to expect other people to respect them or even figure them out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way of the Essentialist is different. The Essentialist looks ahead. She plans. She prepares for different contingencies. She expects the unexpected. She creates a buffer to prepare for the unforeseen, thus giving herself some wiggle room when things come up, as they inevitably do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Essentialists accept the reality that we can never fully anticipate or prepare for every scenario or eventuality; the future is simply too unpredictable. Instead, they build in buffers to reduce the friction caused by the unexpected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentialists produce more by removing more instead of doing more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Essentialists don’t default to Band-Aid solutions. Instead of looking for the most obvious or immediate obstacles, they look for the ones slowing down progress. They ask, “What is getting in the way of achieving what is essential?” While the Nonessentialist is busy applying more and more pressure and piling on more and more solutions, the Essentialist simply makes a one-time investment in removing obstacles. This approach goes beyond just solving problems; it’s a method of reducing your efforts to maximize your results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentialists make progress by making small and concrete wins. It’s harder to make achievement when you set big, lofty, and impossible goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way of the Nonessentialist is to go big on everything: to try to do it all, have it all, fit it all in. The Nonessentialist operates under the false logic that the more he strives, the more he will achieve, but the reality is, the more we reach for the stars, the harder it is to get ourselves off the ground.</p>
<p>The way of the Essentialist is different. Instead of trying to accomplish it all and all at once, and flaring out, the Essentialist starts small and celebrates progress. Instead of going for the big, flashy wins that don’t really matter, the Essentialist pursues small and simple wins in areas that are essential.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A popular idea in Silicon Valley is “Done is better than perfect.” The sentiment is not that we should produce rubbish. The idea, as I read it, is not to waste time on nonessentials and just to get the thing done. In entrepreneurial circles the idea is expressed as creating a “minimal viable product.” The idea is, “What is the simplest possible product that will be useful and valuable to the intended customer?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personalizing patterns of action (i.e. routine) allows us to pay more attention to matters that count rather than to other’s expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way of the Nonessentialist is to think the essentials only get done when they are forced. That execution is a matter of raw effort alone. You labor to make it happen. You push through.</p>
<p>The way of the Essentialist is different. The Essentialist designs a routine that makes achieving what you have identified as essential the default position. Yes, in some instances an Essentialist still has to work hard, but with the right routine in place each effort yields exponentially greater results.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be present - Focus on what is important now. Don’t pretend that you can multifocus. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As he tells his players: “There is a difference between losing and being beaten. Being beaten means they are better than you. They are faster, stronger, and more talented.” To Larry, losing means something else. It means you lost focus. It means you didn’t concentrate on what was essential. It is all based on a simple but powerful idea: to operate at your highest level of contribution requires that you deliberately tune in to what is important in the here and now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ancient Greeks had two words for time. The first was chronos. The second was kairos. The Greek god Chronos was imagined as an elderly, gray-haired man, and his name connotes the literal ticking clock, the chronological time, the kind we measure (and race about trying to use efficiently). Kairos is different. While it is difficult to translate precisely, it refers to time that is opportune, right, different. Chronos is quantitative; kairos is qualitative. The latter is experienced only when we are fully in the moment-when we exist in the now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nonessentialists tend to be so preoccupied with past successes and failures, as well as future challenges and opportunities, that they miss the present moment. They become distracted. Unfocused. They aren’t really there.<br>The way of the Essentialist is to tune into the present. To experience life in kairos, not just chronos. To focus on the things that are truly important-not yesterday or tomorrow, but right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can easily do two things at the same time. What we can’t do is concentrate on two things at the same time. When I talk about being present, I’m not talking about doing only one thing at a time. I’m talking about being focused on one thing at a time. Multitasking itself is not the enemy of Essentialism; pretending we can “multifocus” is.</p>

<h3 id="Related-to-Leadership"><a href="#Related-to-Leadership" class="headerlink" title="Related to Leadership"></a>Related to Leadership</h3><p>Again, clarity is the key. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there was a high level of clarity of purpose, the teams and the people on it overwhelmingly thrived. When there was a serious lack of clarity about what the team stood for and what their goals and roles were, people experienced confusion, stress, frustration, and ultimately failure. As one senior vice president succinctly summarized it when she looked at the results gathered from her extended team: “Clarity equals success.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nonessentialist disempowers people by allowing ambiguity over who is doing what. Often this is justified in the name of wanting to be a flexible or agile team. But what is actually created is a counterfeit agility. When people don’t know what they are really responsible for and how they will be judged on their performance, when decisions either are or appear to be capricious, and when roles are ill-defined, it isn’t long before people either give up or, worse, become obsessed with trying to look busy and therefore important instead of actually getting any real work done.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nonessentialist leader communicates in code, and as a result people aren’t sure what anything really means. Nonessentialist communication usually is either too general to be actionable or changes so quickly that people are always caught off guard. Essentialist leaders, on the other hand, communicate the right things to the right people at the right time. Essentialist leaders speak succinctly, opting for restraint in their communication to keep the team focused. When they do speak, they are crystal clear. They eschew meaningless jargon, and their message is so consistent it seems almost boring to their ears. In this way, teams are able to pick up the essential through all the trivial noise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apply “less but better” in hiring people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the cost of hiring too many wrong people (and one wrong hire often leads to multiple wrong hires because the wrong person will tend to attract more wrong people) is what Guy Kawasaki called a “Bozo explosion”—a term he uses to describe what happens when a formerly great team or company descends into mediocrity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An Essentialist, on the other hand, is ridiculously selective on talent. She has the discipline to hold out for the perfect hire-no matter how many résumés she has to read, or interviews she has to conduct, or talent searches she has to make-and doesn’t hesitate to remove people who hold the team back. The result is a team full of all-star performers whose collective efforts add up to more than the sum of their parts.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The pursuit of success can be a catalyst for failure. Put another way, success can distract us from focusing on the essential things that produce success in the first place.</li>
<li>We are unprepared in part because, for the first time (in human history), the preponderance of choice has overwhelmed our ability to manage it. We have lost our ability to filter what is important and what isn’t. Psychologists call this “decision fatigue”: the more choices we are forced to make, the more the quality of our decisions deteriorates.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are an overachiever thinking you can do anything, how about taking the challenge of saying no to an opportunity and taking a nap.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stuart Brown, the founder of the National Institute for Play, has studied what are called the play histories of some six thousand individuals and has concluded that play has the power to significantly improve everything from personal health to relationships to education to organizations’ ability to innovate.<br>  “Play,” he says, “leads to brain plasticity, adaptability, and creativ-ity.” As he succinctly puts it, “Nothing fires up the brain like play.”</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>In a Harvard Business Review article called “Sleep Deficit: The Performance Killer,” Charles A. Czeisler, the Baldino Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, has explained how sleep deprivation undermines high performance. He likens sleep deficit to drinking too much alcohol, explaining that pulling an all-nighter i.e., going twenty-four hours without sleep) or having a week of sleeping just four or five hours a night actually “induces an impairment equivalent to a blood alcohol level of 0.1%. Think about this: we would never say, ‘This person is a great worker! He’s drunk all the time!’ yet we continue to celebrate people who sacrifice sleep for work.”</li>
<li>The researchers explained that while we sleep our brains are hard at work encoding and restructuring information. Therefore, when we wake up, our brains may have made new neural connections, thereby opening up a broader range of solutions to problems, literally overnight.</li>

<p>Clarity is critical.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>In my work, I have noticed two common patterns that typically emerge when teams lack clarity of purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>  a. Playing politics</p>
<p>  In the first pattern, the team becomes overly focused on winning the attention of the manager. The problem is, when people don’t know what the end game is, they are unclear about how to win, and as a result they make up their own game and their own rules as they vie for the manager’s favor. Instead of focusing their time and energies on making a high level of contribution, they put all their effort into games like attempting to look better than their peers, demonstrating their self-importance, and echoing their manager’s every idea or sentiment. These kinds of activities are not only nonessential but damaging and counterproductive.</p>
<p>  b. It’s all good (which is bad)</p>
<p>  In the second pattern, teams without purpose become leaderless. With no clear direction, people pursue the things that advance their own short-term interests, with little awareness of how their activities contribute to (or in some cases, derail) the long-term mission of the team as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Uncommit’ is a way to minimize loss and win big.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>Sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue to invest time, money, or energy into something we know is a losing proposition simply because we have already incurred, or sunk, a cost that cannot be re-couped. But of course this can easily become a vicious cycle: the more we invest, the more determined we become to see it through and see our investment pay off. The more we invest in something, the harder it is to let go.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The power of small wins.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Research has shown that of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress. Why? Because a small, concrete win creates momentum and affirms our faith in our further success. In his 1968 Harvard Business Review article entitled “One More Time: How Do You Motivate Employees?” among the most popular Harvard Business Review articles of all time, Frederick Herzberg reveals research showing that the two primary internal motivators for people are achievement and recognition for achievement.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="9">
<li>Indeed, today Zimbardo is attempting a grand social experiment along those lines called the “Heroie Imagination Project.” The logic is to increase the odds of people operating with courage by teaching them the principles of heroism. By encouraging and rewarding heroic acts, Zimbardo believes, we can consciously and deliberately create a system where heroic aets eventually become natural and effortless.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Be present and focus on one thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="10">
<li>Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk who has been called the “world’s calmest man,” has spent a lifetime exploring how to live in kairos, albeit by a different name. He has taught it as mindfulness or maintaining “beginner’s mind.” He has written: “Mindfulness helps you go home to the present. And every time you go there and recognize a condition of happiness that you have, happiness comes.”</li>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bias term does not converge to zero, leading to an asymptotically biased estimator.</li>
<li>This illustrates why naive application of machine learning methods without addressing regularization bias can lead to incorrect estimates of treatment effects.</li>
