          <p>I have read a lot of news and articles, and watched a few interviews regarding AI safety these days. The future of AI is promising. People are working towards more powerful AI and personalized AI assistants or agents. At the same time, AI causes problems. A very obvious downside of AI is people could use AI to do harmful things, but I think people are good to work together and prevent that from different angles such as legal aspect or open source software. I worry more about things that are not easily avoided and cannot be seen at least in these years when AI is still immature - which is being too early to rely on AI and thus deviating from truth. For example, it is too soon for people to lose faith in jobs like teachers, historians, journalists, writers, etc, but I’m concerning people are already losing faith in those jobs because of the development of AI and some violations of copyrighted work. As we have seen that AI could have wrong understanding of facts, have biased opinions, and make things up that don’t exist, we lives could fight for the truth but the dead cannot speak for themselves. It would be pathetic if human live in hallucination in the future, and I don’t know if there’s any good practice to prevent it. It’s like Pandora’s box is opened and complications cannot be stopped. But we should at least think seriously about the potential impact of AI on society and human consciousness and possible unexpected consequences.</p>

<p><em>As Columbia Business School professor Rita McGrath points out, it’s about identifying “the strategic inflection points” at which the cost of waiting exceeds to cost acting — in other words, identifying the most strategic point to enter a market or adopt a technology, balancing the risks and opportunities based on market readiness, technological maturity and organizational capacity.</em></p>
<p><em>This speaks to the growing adoption of agile, “act, learn, build” approaches over traditional “prove-plan-execute” orientations. The popularity of techniques like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/1995/07/discovery-driven-planning">discovery-driven planning</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">the lean startup</a>, and other agile approaches and propagated this philosophy in which, rather than building bullet-proof business cases, one makes small steps, learning from them, and deciding whether to invest further.</em></p>

<p>It’s a very good read. It provided real world business examples such as Nvidia’s partnership with ARM Holdings and Amazon’s Alexa offering for the strategic concept “borrow someone’s road”, Microsoft’s decision to make Office available on Apple’s iOS devices in 2014 and Microsoft’s partnership with Adobe, Salesforce, and Google for the strategic concept “Parter with a third party”, Deere &amp; Co’s decision on openly investing in precision agriculture technologies for the strategic concept “reveal your strategy”, Mastercard’s “Beyond Cash” initiative in 2012 for the strategic concept “be good”, Ferrari’s strategic entry into the luxury SUV market for the strategic concept “let the competition go”, and Tesla’s modular approach to battery manufacturing for the strategic concept “adopt small scale attacks”. </p>

<p><em>Gig work is structured in a way that strengthens the alignment between customers and companies and deepens the divide between customers and workers, leading to systemic imbalances in its service triangle.</em> </p>
<p><em>Bridging the customer-worker divide can result in higher customer trust and platform commitment, both by the customer and the worker.</em> </p>
<p><em>To start, platforms need to increase transparency, reduce information asymmetry, and price their services clearly, allowing customers to better understand what they are paying for rather than only seeing an aggregated total at the end of the transaction. This, in turn, can help customers get used to the idea that if workers are to be paid fairly, gig work cannot be a free or low-cost service.</em></p>
<p><em>Gig workers might be working through an app, but they are not robots, and they deserve to be treated respectfully and thoughtfully. So tip well, rate appropriately, and work together to make the experience as smooth as possible both for yourself and for workers.</em></p>

<p>This is a good article for better understanding how gig work structured differently than other business model, and what the key points are for better business performance and triangle relationships.</p>

<p><em>TCP&#x2F;IP unlocked new economic value by dramatically lowering the cost of connections. Similarly, blockchain could dramatically reduce the cost of transactions. It has the potential to become the system of record for all transactions. If that happens, the economy will once again undergo a radical shift, as new, blockchain-based sources of influence and control emerge.</em></p>
<p><em>“Smart contracts” may be the most transformative blockchain application at the moment. These automate payments and the transfer of currency or other assets as negotiated conditions are met. For example, a smart contract might send a payment to a supplier as soon as a shipment is delivered. A firm could signal via blockchain that a particular good has been receivedor the product could have GPS functionality, which would automatically log a location update that, in turn, triggered a payment. We’ve already seen a few early experiments with such self-executing contracts in the areas of venture funding, banking, and digital rights management.</em></p>
<p><em>The implications are fascinating. Firms are built on contracts, from incorporation to buyer-supplier relationships to employee relations. If contracts are automated, then what will happen to traditional firm structures, processes, and intermediaries like lawyers and accountants? And what about managers? Their roles would all radically change. Before we get too excited here, though, let’s remember that we are decades away from the widespread adoption of smart contracts. They cannot be effective, for instance, without institutional buy-in. A tremendous degree of coordination and clarity on how smart contracts are designed, verified, implemented, and enforced will be required. We believe the institutions responsible for those daunting tasks will take a long time to evolve, And the technology challenges especially security are daunting.</em></p>
<p><strong>―  “The Truth About Blockchain”, Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain">Article</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the second Blockchain related article I have read from Harvard Business Review. Different authors have different perspectives. Unlike the previous article with a lot of concerns and cautions about Web3, this article seems more optimistic. It proposed a framework for adopting blockchain to revolutionize modern business, and a guidance to Blockchain investment. It points out that Blockchain has great potentials in boosting the efficiency and reducing the cost for all transactions and then explained the reason why the adoption of Blockchain would be slow by making a comparison with TCP&#x2F;IP, which took more than 30 years to reshape the economy by dramatically lowering the cost of connections. This is an interesting comparison: e-mail enabled bilateral messaging as the first application of TCP&#x2F;IP, while bitcoin enables bilateral financial transactions as the first application of Blockchain. It reminds me about what people (Jun Lei, Huateng Ma, Lei Ding, etc) were thinking about internet mindset and business model back in 2000s.</p>
<p>In the end, the authors proposed a four-quadrant framework for adopting Blockchain step by step. The four quadrants are created by two dimensions: novelty (equivalent to the amount of efforts required to ensure users understand the problem) and complexity (equivalent to the amount of coordination and collaboration required to produce values). With the increase of both dimensions, the adoption will require more institutional change. An example of “low novelty and low complexity” is simply adding bitcoin as an alternative transaction method. An example of “low novelty and high complexity” is building a new, fully formed cryptocurrency system which requires wide adoption from every monetary transaction party and consumers’ complete understanding of cryptocurrency. An example of “high novelty and low complexity” is building a local private network on which multiple organizations are connected via a distributed ledger. An example of “high novelty and high complexity” is building “smart contracts”.</p>

<p> <em>If someone whom you don’t trust or an adversary gets something more powerful, then I think that that could be an issue. Probably the best way to mitigate that is to have good open source AI that becomes the standard and in a lot of ways can become the leader.

</blockquote>
<p>What I learned from this interview: The future of Meta AI would be a kind of AI general assistant product where you give it complicated tasks and then it goes away and does them. Meta will probably build bigger clusters. No one has built 1GW data center yet but building it could just be a matter of time. Open source can be both bad and good. People can use LLM to do harmful things, while what Mask worries more about is the concentration of AI, where there is an untrustworthy actor having the super strong AI. Open source software can make AI not getting stuck in one company but can be broadly deployed to a lot of different systems. People can set standards on how it works and AI can get checked and upgraded together. </p>

<p><em>Humans do inspiration; machines do validation.</em> </p>
<p><em>Math is good at optimizing a known system; humans are good at finding a new one. Put another way, change favors local maxima; innovation favors global disruption.</em></p>
<p><strong>―  “Lean Analytics, Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes people who are doing hard data work usually forget to step back and look at the big picture. This is a common mistake because we can definitely go from scientific data analysis to actionable insight for making better business decision. But we need to have some additional thoughts about whether the decision is a global optima or it’s just local due to the limited sample, restricted project goal, or restricted team scope.</p>
<ol start="2">

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When I decided to end my voluntary immersion in the driver community, I could not shake the feeling that the depersonalization of app workers is a feature, not a bug, of an economic model born of and emboldened by transformations that are underway across the global economy. This includes increasingly prevalent work arrangements characterized by weak employer-worker relations (independent contracting), strong reliance on technology (algorithmic management, platform-mediated communication), and social isolation (no coworkers and limited customer interactions).</em></p>
<p><em>As forces continue to erode traditional forms of identity support, meaningful selfdefinition at work will increasingly rely on how we collectively use and misuse innovative technologies and business models.</em><br><em>For example, how can companies deploy algorithmic management in a way that doesn’t threaten and depersonalize workers? How can focusing on the narratives that underlie and animate identities help workers reimagine what they really want and deserve out of a career coming out of the pandemic and the Great Resignation? Will increasingly immersive and realistic digital environments like the metaverse function as identity playgrounds for workers in the future? How will Web3 broadly, and the emergence of novel forms of organizing specifically (e.g., decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs), affect the careers, connections, and causes that are so important to workers? What role can social media platforms, online discussion forums, and other types of virtual water coolers play in helping independent workers craft and sustain a desirable work identity? In short, how can we retain the human element in the face of increasingly shrewd resource management tactics?”</em></p>

<p>This reminds me that last year when I was on vacation in LA, I’ve talked to a driver worked for both Lyft and Uber in LA. He complained Lyft’s route recommendation algorithm is shitty, not helpful at all, a waste of time, while Uber is better in comparison. At that time I realized how important it is to strengthen employer worker relations and gather feedback from workers or clients on the product improvement.<br>This is a great article where the author raises his concerns of dehumanization of workers in the future. While technology is advancing and economy is transforming, we don’t expect people to forget who they are in their daily basis work.</p>

<p><em>Bringing a new technology to market presents a chicken-or-egg problem: The product needs a supply of complementary offerings, but the suppliers and complementors don’t exist yet, and no entrepreneur wants to throw their lot in with a technology that isn’t on the market yet.</em></p>
<p><em>There are two ways of “solving” this problem. First, you can time the market, and wait until the ecosystem matures— though you risk waiting a long time. Second, you can drive the market, or supply all the necessary inputs and complements yourself.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here are two examples. To drive the market, Musk supplies both electric vehicles and charging stations. Zuckerberg proposed the concept of metaverse and changed his company’s name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is where Musk’s Wall Street critics might say he’s weakest. Many of his businesses don’t articulate a clear logic, which is demonstrated by the unpredictable way these businesses ultimately reach solutions or products.</em></p>
<p><em>Musk has spelled out some of his prior logic in a set of “Master Plans,” but most of the logical basis for exactly how he will succeed remains ambiguous. But this isn’t necessarily Musk’s fault or due to any negligence per se: When pursuing new technologies, particularly ones that open up a new market, there is no one who can anticipate the full set of possibilities of what that technology will be able to do (and what it will not be able to do).</em></p>

<p>Elon is interesting, but I have to say that we human need this type of person to leap to the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What could he possibly want with Twitter? The thing is, over the last decade, the technological landscape has changed, and how and when to moderate speech has become a critical problem-and an existential problem for social media companies. In other words, moderating speech has looked more and more like the kind of big, complex strategic problem that captures Musk’s interest.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a great article which profiles Elon Musk specifically in his strategies and vision. It answered my question confusing me for two years: what was Musk thinking on buying Twitter? The answer is: Musk’s vision is not in pursuit of a specific type of solution but is in pursuit of a specific type of problem. If we go back to 2016, Igor as a CEO of Disney decided not to buy Twitter because he looked at Twitter as the solution: a global distribution platform, while concerned the quality of speech on it is a problem. Musk was looking for challenges and complexities while Igor was preventing them and looking for solutions.</p>

<p><em>“One of the things that I think OpenAI is doing that is the most important of everything that we are doing is putting powerful technology in the hands of people for free as a public good. We don’t run ads on our free version. We don’t monetize it in other ways. I think that kind of ‘open’ is very important, and is a huge deal for how we fulfill the mission. “― Sam</em></p>
<p><em>“For active learning, the thing is it truly needs a problem. It needs a problem that requires it. It is very hard to do research about the capability of active learning if you don’t have a task.

<p><em>“To build an AGI, I think it’s going to be Deep Learning plus some ideas, and self-play would be one of these ideas. Self-play has such properties that can surprise us in truly novel ways. Almost all self-play systems produce surprising behaviors that we didn’t expect. They are creating solutions to problems.”, “Not just random surprise but to find the surprising solution to a problem.”― Ilya</em></p>
<p><em>“Transferring from simulation to the real world is definitely possible and it’s been exhibited many times by many different groups. It’s been especially successful in vision. Also OpenAI in the summer has demonstrated robot hand which was trained entirely in simulation. “, “The policy that it learned in simulation was trained to be very adaptive. So adaptive that when you transfer if could very quickly adapt to the physical world.”― Ilya</em></p>
<p><em>“The real world that I would imagine is one where humanity are like the board members of a company where the AGI is the CEO. The picture I would imagine is you have some kind of different entities, countries or cities, and the people who live there vote for what the AGI that represents them should do. You could have multiple AGIs, you would have an AGI for a city, for a country, and it would be trying to in effects take the democratic process to the next level.” “(And the board can always fire the CEO), press the reset button, re-randomize the parameters.”― Ilya</em></p>

<p>I watched Lex’s interview with Sam Altman uploaded on March 18, 2024, and an older interview with Ilya Sutskever happened 3 years ago. Elon’s lawsuit against OpenAI frustrated Sam but Sam is optimistic about the future and everything he is going to release in the next few months. Sam answered the questions “what does open mean in OpenAI” that ‘open’ mainly means putting powerful tech in the hands of people for free as a public good, but not necessarily mean open-source. He said there can be open-source models or closed-source models. About the transition between non-profit to capped for-profit, Sam said OpenAI is not setting a precedent for startup to mimic it but he suggested most startups should go for for-profit directly if they pursue profitability in the beginning.</p>
<p>Ilya’s interview is more interesting to me because he talked a lot about vision, tech, philosophy in Deep Learning. It’s impressive that he had such thoughts 3 years ago. </p>

<p><em>Speech is one kind of liability for companies using generative AI. The design of these systems can create other kinds of harms—by, say, introducing bias in hiring, giving bad advice, or simply making up information that might lead to financial damages for a person who trusts these systems.</em></p>
<p><em>Because AIs can be used in so many ways, in so many industries, it may take time to understand what their harms are in a variety of contexts, and how best to regulate them, says Schultz.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Section 230 of Communications Decency Act of 1996 has protected internet platforms from being held liable for the things we say on them, but it doesn’t cover speech that a company’s  AI generates. It’s likely that in the future companies use AI will be liable for whatever it does. It could be a driver of pushing companies to take effort to avoid problematic AI output, and reduce “hallucinations” (when GenAI makes stuff up). </p>
<p>A very obvious downside is people could use AI to do harmful things, but I think people are good to work together and prevent that from different angles such as legal aspect or open source software. I worry more about things that are potential or cannot be seen at least in these years when AI is still immature - which is being too early to rely on AI and deviating from truth. For example, it is too soon for people to lose faith in jobs like teachers, historians, journalists, writers, etc, but I’m concerning people are already losing faith in those jobs because of the development of AI and some violations of copyrighted work. As we have seen that AI could have wrong understanding of facts, have biased opinions, and make things up that don’t exist, we lives could fight for the truth but the dead cannot talk. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The qubit in superposition has some probability of being 1 or 0, but it represents neither state, just like our quarter flipping into the air is neither heads nor tails, but some probability of both. A quantum computer can use a collection of qubits in superpositions to play with different possible paths through a calculation. If done correctly, the pointers to incorrect paths cancel out, leaving the correct answer when the qubits are read out as Os and 1s.</em></p>
<p><em>Grover’s algorithm, a famous quantum search algorithm, could find you in a phone book of 100 million names with just 10,000 operations. If a classical search algorithm just spooled through all the listings to find you, it would require 50 million operations, on average.</em></p>
<p><em>Qubits have to be carefully shielded, and operated at very cold temperatures-sometimes only fractions of a degree above absolute zero. A major area of research involves developing algorithms for a quantum computer to correct its own errors, caused by glitching qubits.</em></p>
<p><em>Some researchers, most notably at Microsoft, hope to sidestep this challenge by developing a type of qubit out of clusters of electrons known as a topological qubit. Physicists predict topological qubits to be more robust to environmental noise and thus less error-prone, but so far they’ve struggled to make even one.</em></p>
<p><em>Teams in both the public and private sector are betting so, as Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft have all expanded their teams working on the technology, with a growing swarm of startups such as Xanadu and QuEra in hot pursuit. The US, China, and the European Union each have new programs measured in the billions of dollars to stimulate quantum R&amp;D. Some startups, such as Rigetti and lonQ, have even begun trading publicly on the stock market by merging with a so-called special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC-a trick to quickly gain access to cash.</em></p>
<p><em>Chemistry simulations may be the first practical use for these prototype machines, as researchers are figuring out how to make their qubits interact like electrons in a molecule. Daimler and Volkswagen have both started investigating quantum computing as a way to improve battery chemistry for electric vehicles. Microsoft says other uses could include designing new catalysts to make industrial processes less energy intensive, or even pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change. Tech companies like Google are also betting that quantum computers can make artificial intelligence more powerful.</em></p>
<p><em>Big Tech companies argue that programmers need to get ready now. Google, IBM, and Microsoft have all released open source tools to help coders familiarize themselves with writing programs for quantum hardware. IBM offers online access to some of its quantum processors, so anyone can experiment with them. Launched in 2019, Amazon Web Services offers a service that connects users to startup-built quantum computers made of various qubit types over the cloud. In 2020, the US government launched an initiative to develop a K-12 curriculum relating to quantum computing. That same year, the University of New South Wales in Australia offered the world’s first bachelor’s degree in quantum engineering.</em></p>

<p>This article is pretty comprehensive in describing quantum computing mechanism and techniques. One interesting fact is that quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into bank accounts and breaking encryption and cryptography. Shor’s algorithm has been proven mathematically that if you had a large enough quantum computer, you could find the prime factor of large numbers - the basis of RSA encryption, the most commonly used thing on the internet. Although we are far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute Shor’s algorithm on that scale, cryptography research has already been preparing for quantum computers’ code-breaking capabilities.</p>

<p><em>Biderman notes that the leak is likely harmful in terms of reducing trust between companies like Meta and the academics they share their research with. “If we don’t respect people’s good faith attempts to disseminate technology in ways that are consistent with their legal and ethical obligations, that’s only going to create a more adversarial relationship between the public and researchers and make it harder for people to release things,” she notes.</em></p>

<p>Meta is taking the lead of open-source LLM by releasing the AI language model LLaMA. Some say open source is necessary to ensure AI safety and faster LLM progress. Others argue that there will be more personalized spam and phishing due to the fact of the model has already leaked on 4chan, and a wave of malicious use of AI. There are pros and cons of open sourcing LLM, just like last year OpenAI open sourced Stable Diffusion which has a lot of bad potential influences. But while every is making AI models private, there has to be someone who makes it public, then everyone goes public. The good and necessary thing is that open source software can help decentralize AI power.</p>

<p><em>The OpenAI chief executive officer is in talks with investors including the United Arab Emirates government to raise funds for a wildly ambitious tech initiative that would boost the world’s chip-building capacity, expand its ability to power AI, among other things, and cost several trillion dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. The project could require raising as much as $5 trillion to $7 trillion, one of the people said.</em> </p>

<p><em>“Sora has a deep understanding of language, enabling it to accurately interpret prompts and generate compelling characters that express vibrant emotions,” OpenAI writes in a blog post. “The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt, but also how those things exist in the physical world.”</em></p>
<p><em>“[Sora] may struggle with accurately simulating the physics of a complex scene, and may not understand specific instances of cause and effect. For example, a person might take a bite out of a cookie, but afterward, the cookie may not have a bite mark. The model may also confuse spatial details of a prompt, for example, mixing up left and right, and may struggle with precise descriptions of events that take place over time, like following a specific camera trajectory.”</em></p>

<p>OpenAI released amazing technology again! Compared to other release language models, Sora seems to start to have the capability of understanding physical world, but OpenAI acknowledged that that might not be true. In the meantime, Meta developed V-JEPA, which is not focusing on linking language to videos, but learning the cause and effect from videos and gaining the capability of understand and reason the object-object interactions in the physical world. </p>

<p><em>A topological qubit is a system that encodes data into the properties of pairs of non-Abelian anyons by physically swapping them around with each other in space. Non-Abelian anyons is desirable component for holding and manipulating information in quantum computers because of its resilience which is rooted in math from the field of topology - the study of spatial relationships and geometry that hold true even when shapes are distorted.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Researcher from Google and Quantinuum demonstrated a mechanism needed for a component called a topological qubit, which should promise a means to maintain and manipulate information encoded into quantum states more robustly than existing hardware designs. Topological qubits store and work with digital information in non-Abelian anyons, which retain a sort of “memory” of their past movement that enables the representation of binary data. While physicists previous proved the existence of non-Abelian anyons, Quantinuum’s and Google’s work are the first to demonstrate their signature feature, memory of movement. However, people disagreed that topological qubit has been created because the object was too fragile for practical use and cannot reliably manipulate information to achieve practical quantum computing. Delivering a practical topological qubit will require all kinds of studies of non-Abelian anyons and the math underpinning their quirky behavior. Technological breakthrough can be expected after incremental progress.</p>

<p><em>Optimizing LLMs to run on battery-powered devices has been a growing focus for AI researchers. Academic papers are not a direct indicator of how Apple intends to add new features to its products, but they offer a rare glimpse into its secretive research labs and the company’s latest technical breakthroughs.</em></p>
<p><em>“Our work not only provides a solution to a current computational bottleneck but also sets a precedent for future research,” wrote Apple’s researchers in the conclusion to their paper. “We believe as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, approaches like this work will be essential for harnessing their full potential in a wide range of devices and applications.”</em></p>

<p>Apple is developing solutions to running LLM or other AI models directly on a customer’s iPhone.

Apple’s focus is different from Microsoft’s and Google’s focus of developing Chatbots and GenAI over the Internet from cloud computing platform. I think the smartphone market would be revived and customer experience would be largely changed in the future with this potential vision of personalized and mobile AI agents &#x2F; assistants. If this personalized little AI agent can learn everything about a person from childhood to adult, can we eventually get a perfect adult mind? It reminds me of what Alan Turing said about AI: </p>
<p><em>“Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.”</em></p>

<p>This article (Quick Essay: A Short History of OpenAI) reviewed the history of OpenAl from 2015 when it’s founded to 2023 when Sam was once fired. A crucial development happened in 2018 when the company first introduced the foundational architecture of GPT in a paper “Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training”. This leads to the flagship product of the company - ChatGPT, in Nov 2022. In 2019 OpenAl transited from nonprofit to a “capped-profit” model. This novel convoluted corporate structure led to conflicting motivations and incentives within the company and it latter raised board’s concern about company’s commitment to safety.</p>
<p>Sam Altman was fired on Nov 17, 2023. On Nov 19, 2023, OpenAl hired former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as its interim CEO. Meanwhile Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that they would hired Sam to lead a new Al department. On Nov 20, 2023, Nearly all 800 OpenAl employees signed a letter calling for the resignation of the company’s board and the return of Altman as CEO. On Nov 21, 2023, Sam returned as CEO of OpenAl.</p>
<p>One story in 2020: Two of the lead Al developers Amodei and his sister Daniela left OpenAl in late 2020 to launch Anthropic over concerns the company was moving too quickly to commercialize its technology. Anthropic was founded aiming to develop more safer and trustworthy model and it has billions invested from Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Zoom, etc.</p>
<p>Since Sam was rehired, the questions about neglecting Al safety has been quieted, and new board members appear to be more focused on profitability. There is no doubt of OpenAl’s capability of profitably scaling ChatGPT, but it should raise doubts about whether OpenAl is still committing to its purpose in the future. </p>
<p>Sutskever was recruited to OpenAl from Google in 2015 by Elon Musk, who describes him as “the linchpin for OpenAl being successful”. A tweet from Greg Brockman confirms that Ilya was a key figure in Altman’s removal. But Sutskever also a signee calling Sam back to CEO. He later said he deeply regret his participation in the board’s actions.</p>

          <p>Hello World, </p>
<p>This is Di, living in my 25th year of life. I’m an INTJ.</p>
<p>It’s been half a year since I graduated from school and started my career. School life and work life are drastically different but both of them are fascinating. I will always live a good life no matter what happened though. I have changed a lot after school in many things such as habit and mindset. But one habit never changes is daily reading and learning. (Here are some of my pre-25-year-old notes: <a href="https://jokerdii.github.io/">https://jokerdii.github.io/</a>) </p>
<p>I still remember at the time when ChatGPT released I was taking “Quantitative Methods in NLP” course at MIT. Then I observed AI waves got stronger in 2023. Technology changed rapidly throughout the year with one great paper followed by another. And human’s life started to change rapidly as well. I don’t know whether it is because a lot of things going on outside, my mind is excited and spinning with full of information every single day. </p>
<p>I never had a habit of taking diary in my life. I didn’t film my life and I use social media only for chatting and “friend making”. But I finally decided to start it specifically for documenting what I read and learned in my spare time. And it is for me internal use only because 1) I’d like to write something as an output to make sure my brain exactly gets the input, and 2) I’d like to document great things because my brain has a very limited memory.</p>
