<p><strong>Can Large Language Models Reason? - AI: A Guide for Thinking Humans</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current evidence suggests that LLMs simulate reasoning rather than genuinely reasoning. This highlights the need for careful evaluation of LLMs’ generalization capabilities, especially as AI is increasingly integrated into complex decision-making contexts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Meta’s early AR unveiling may come with competitive trade-offs. According to Bloomberg, Apple has launched its own smart glasses initiative, a market study called “Atlas,” signaling a potential shift from its high-end $3,500 Vision Pro VR headset. Apple recently cut its Vision Pro shipment target to less than half a million units in the first year—down from an initial target of 3 million.</em></p>
<p><em>Meta is pursuing a two-pronged approach to AR glasses:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Orion has a hardware challenge (powerful but still cumbersome).</em></li>
<li><em>Rayban Meta glasses have a software challenge (lightweight but only offering relatively simple use cases).</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>― Meta: AI Killed The Video Star - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/meta-ai-killed-the-video-star">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current stage of Meta Orion: 1) prototype (not product), 2) advanced AR display (micro LED projectors and silicon carbide lenses), 3) interactive AI capabilities, 4) hardware complexity (neural wristband for control and a wireless compute puck for functionality), 5) high costs ($10K per unit) and limited production, 6) future vision - to release a consumer-ready AR device within a few years, targeting a more affordable product closer to smartphone price levels.</p>
<p>AI’s impact on Meta: 1) engagement: Meta’s recommendation system provides most relevant content to users, attracting users to spend more time on Apps, 2) monetization: Gen AI assists with ad copy, image, and video production, while new models analyze user actions before serving specific ads, ultimately increasing conversions at the margins.</p>
<p>About Meta AI Studio (for developers to create, train, and deploy custom AI models across Meta’s ecosystem): the goal is to drive the next wave of consumer apps and maximize ad potential across its platforms.</p>
<p>The discussion on “The Death of Creator Economy” is interesting and insightful. It’s true - as Meta moves towards an AI-centered model, creators may find themselves competing against the platforms that once supported them. By relying on AI, Meta could optimize ad placements and user engagement without the cost of creator compensation. This is a departure from platforms like YouTube, which incentivize creators with ad revenue shares. The broader impact could reshape the landscape of online content. As AI-generated feeds become the norm, audiences may eventually consume content that’s been strategically tailored by algorithms rather than creators. The creative autonomy that once defined social media could shift to a more managed, homogenized experience, where what we see is driven less by personal expression and more by AI-calculated engagement metrics. </p>

<li>Browser based Agent -  Project Jarvis: an AI technology that can autonomously take over a web browser to handle tasks like research and shopping. </li>
<li>Waymo - closed massive funding round and has secured $5.6B. mMajor backers are Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price. Expansion would be driven by new funding through partnership with Uber.</li>
<li>AI power - Alphabet is partnering with Kairos Tech to harness small nuclear reactors to power AI data centers.</li>
<li>Search and competition: Google’s losing market share to TikTok and AI startups (Perplexity and OpenAI) but it is still the largest. Amazon’s search is catching up. TikTok and AI Chatbots are still tiny. Google’s decline in market share is likely primarily due to e-commerce based search on platform (Amazon).</li>

<p><em>Tesla’s Cybercab could either compete with Uber’s platform or, as Khosrowshahi suggests, Cybercab fleet owners might choose to list their vehicles on Uber to maximize earnings. Uber’s reach and ability to cover diverse use cases—across vehicle sizes, geographies, and special needs—could lead to a hybrid model where Tesla AVs appear on Uber.</em></p>
<p><em>Tesla could ultimately leverage Uber’s scale and network, given the challenge of reaching a critical size in specific markets. AVs on Uber are already a reality with Waymo, and more will likely come.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Business Insights: </p>
<ol>
<li>Deliveries rebounded in Q3, leading to an auto gross margin improvement.</li>
<li>Roughly 20% of Tesla‘s gross margin came from non-auto segments—nearly doubling from a year ago. </li>
<li>Lower cost per vehicle, growth in non-auto segments, FSD revenue, growth in deliveries, and higher regulatory credit revenue contribute to operating margin.</li>
<li>Free cash flow expanded and balance sheet remains stellar.</li>
</ol>
<p>“We, Robot”s takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cybercab (robotaxi), Optimus (Humanoid Robot), Robovan</li>
<li>FSD progress: promised to enable fully autonomous driving by 2026</li>
<li>Market reaction: uncertain about the timeline</li>
<li>Supercharger network: Most automakers have adopted Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS). </li>
<li>Market share: Tesla’s vehicles market share has stabilized in North America and Europe but noticeably improved in China.</li>
<li>AI power: Musk still expects nearly 90,000 H100 clusters dedicated to training by the end of this year.</li>
<li>Energy storage deployment</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparing Tesla and Waymo:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to six SAE levels of driving automation (0 no automation, 1driver assistance, 2 partial automation, 3 conditional automation, 4 high automation, 5 full automation), Tesla’s FSD remains at level 2, while Waymo operates at level 4. </li>
<li>Tesla relies on cameras and AI while Waymo relies on heavy hardware (LiDAR, radar, cameras).</li>
<li>Waymo’s reliance on expensive hardware limits its ability to scale quickly ($ 200K per vehicle). Tesla aims to scale faster by leveraging its existing fleet to train its AI models. </li>
<li>Waymo has built trust with regulators by gradually deploying its vehicles, whileTesla faces regulatory hurdles particularly with the Cybercab.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>They introduced GRIPS (Gradient-free Instructional Prompt Search) as a gradient-free, edit-based method to improve natural language prompts for LLMs without needing gradient-based tuning. </p>
<p>RIPS takes human-designed instructions and automatically edits them to enhance performance. It involves random phrase-level edits like deletion, swapping, paraphrasing, and addition, which are scored based on task performance.</p>

<p><strong>Large Language Models as Optimizers</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This research introduces Optimization by Prompting (OPRO), an approach that leverages LLMs as optimizers by using natural language to describe optimization tasks. OPRO can be applied to linear regression, traveling salesman, and prompt optimization, where OPRO finds instructions that maximize task accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting findings on model variability: 1) Significant performance variations when questions are rephrased or when only numerical values are altered. 2) Models demonstrate robustness to superficial changes (e.g., proper names) but are highly sensitive to numerical changes. </p>
<p>Interesting findings on model complexity and fragility: 1) Model performance deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases, revealing challenges with handling complexity, 2) Adding irrelevant but seemingly relevant clauses leads to a performance drop of up to 65% in some models.</p>
<p>Insights in reasoning: 1) The decline in performance suggests LLMs rely on pattern matching rather than genuine logical reasoning, 2) Models replicate training data patterns rather than solving problems from first principles.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking LLMs: General Instruction Following with Thought Generation</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10630">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current LLM has a problem of lacking internal reasoning processes before outputting responses. Explicit thinking can enhance performance on complex tasks, including creative writing and problem-solving, by allowing models to internally reason and plan responses. The author introduces Introduces Thought Preference Optimization (TPO) which allows LLMs to generate multiple thought-response pairs for each instruction, while a judge model evaluates responses, selecting the best and worst pairs for optimization.</p>

<p>They introduced the Agent-as-a-Judge Framework to evaluate agentic systems, addressing limitations of existing evaluation methods like LLM-as-a-Judge by offering dynamic, step-by-step feedback throughout task-solving processes.</p>

<p><em>Difficulties handling numbers may stem from the fact that most models rely on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198">autoregressive next token prediction pretext tasks</a> during training, which <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06963">might not be suitable for mathematical operations</a>, or simply because a limited number of numerical reasoning tasks are included in the model’s training corpora. Nevertheless, it is known that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05398">performance can be improved using prompt techniques</a>, indicating that relevant knowledge may already exist within LLMs.</em></p>
