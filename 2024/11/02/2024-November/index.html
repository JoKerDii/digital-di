<p>Highlight what to watch looking forward: 1) Microsoft is addressing its data centers’ increasing power demands by turning to nuclear energy, 2) Microsoft is launching autonomous AI agents in November, introducing tools that enable businesses to automate routine tasks and boosting efficiency: Copilot Studio allows business create their own AI agents with minimal coding knowledge; and it will offer 10 ready-to-use agents covering everyday business needs.</p>

<p><strong>Can Large Language Models Reason? - AI: A Guide for Thinking Humans</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current evidence suggests that LLMs simulate reasoning rather than genuinely reasoning. This highlights the need for careful evaluation of LLMs’ generalization capabilities, especially as AI is increasingly integrated into complex decision-making contexts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Meta’s early AR unveiling may come with competitive trade-offs. According to Bloomberg, Apple has launched its own smart glasses initiative, a market study called “Atlas,” signaling a potential shift from its high-end $3,500 Vision Pro VR headset. Apple recently cut its Vision Pro shipment target to less than half a million units in the first year—down from an initial target of 3 million.</em></p>
<p><em>Meta is pursuing a two-pronged approach to AR glasses:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Orion has a hardware challenge (powerful but still cumbersome).</em></li>
<li><em>Rayban Meta glasses have a software challenge (lightweight but only offering relatively simple use cases).</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>― Meta: AI Killed The Video Star - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/meta-ai-killed-the-video-star">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current stage of Meta Orion: 1) prototype (not product), 2) advanced AR display (micro LED projectors and silicon carbide lenses), 3) interactive AI capabilities, 4) hardware complexity (neural wristband for control and a wireless compute puck for functionality), 5) high costs ($10K per unit) and limited production, 6) future vision - to release a consumer-ready AR device within a few years, targeting a more affordable product closer to smartphone price levels.</p>
<p>AI’s impact on Meta: 1) engagement: Meta’s recommendation system provides most relevant content to users, attracting users to spend more time on Apps, 2) monetization: Gen AI assists with ad copy, image, and video production, while new models analyze user actions before serving specific ads, ultimately increasing conversions at the margins.</p>
<p>About Meta AI Studio (for developers to create, train, and deploy custom AI models across Meta’s ecosystem): the goal is to drive the next wave of consumer apps and maximize ad potential across its platforms.</p>
<p>The discussion on “The Death of Creator Economy” is interesting and insightful. It’s true - as Meta moves towards an AI-centered model, creators may find themselves competing against the platforms that once supported them. By relying on AI, Meta could optimize ad placements and user engagement without the cost of creator compensation. This is a departure from platforms like YouTube, which incentivize creators with ad revenue shares. The broader impact could reshape the landscape of online content. As AI-generated feeds become the norm, audiences may eventually consume content that’s been strategically tailored by algorithms rather than creators. The creative autonomy that once defined social media could shift to a more managed, homogenized experience, where what we see is driven less by personal expression and more by AI-calculated engagement metrics. </p>

<p>What’s next:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browser based Agent -  Project Jarvis: an AI technology that can autonomously take over a web browser to handle tasks like research and shopping. </li>
<li>Waymo - closed massive funding round and has secured $5.6B. mMajor backers are Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price. Expansion would be driven by new funding through partnership with Uber.</li>
<li>AI power - Alphabet is partnering with Kairos Tech to harness small nuclear reactors to power AI data centers.</li>
<li>Search and competition: Google’s losing market share to TikTok and AI startups (Perplexity and OpenAI) but it is still the largest. Amazon’s search is catching up. TikTok and AI Chatbots are still tiny. Google’s decline in market share is likely primarily due to e-commerce based search on platform (Amazon).</li>

</blockquote>
<p>On advertising: sponsored products remain a critical growth driver. Ad-supported Prime Video introduced in Q1 2024 automatically converted all Prime members to an ad-supported tier.</p>
<p>On lowering the cost to serve: 1) Expanding with over 15 new inbound buildings across the US, 2) Increasing same-day deliveries, 3) Advancing robotics and automation.</p>
<p>On pharmacy: significantly expanded with rapid delivery capability.</p>
<p>On Capex: aggressive infrastructure investments.</p>
<p>On Project Kuiper: Kuiper aims to provide fast, affordable internet via satellite. It is early in its journey but holds transformative potential for Amazon’s growth. </p>

<p><em>Tesla’s Cybercab could either compete with Uber’s platform or, as Khosrowshahi suggests, Cybercab fleet owners might choose to list their vehicles on Uber to maximize earnings. Uber’s reach and ability to cover diverse use cases—across vehicle sizes, geographies, and special needs—could lead to a hybrid model where Tesla AVs appear on Uber.</em></p>
<p><em>Tesla could ultimately leverage Uber’s scale and network, given the challenge of reaching a critical size in specific markets. AVs on Uber are already a reality with Waymo, and more will likely come.</em></p>
<p><strong>― Tesla: Autonomy Gamble - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/tesla-autonomy-gamble">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Business Insights: </p>
<ol>
<li>Deliveries rebounded in Q3, leading to an auto gross margin improvement.</li>
<li>Roughly 20% of Tesla‘s gross margin came from non-auto segments—nearly doubling from a year ago. </li>
<li>Lower cost per vehicle, growth in non-auto segments, FSD revenue, growth in deliveries, and higher regulatory credit revenue contribute to operating margin.</li>
<li>Free cash flow expanded and balance sheet remains stellar.</li>
</ol>
<p>“We, Robot”s takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cybercab (robotaxi), Optimus (Humanoid Robot), Robovan</li>
<li>FSD progress: promised to enable fully autonomous driving by 2026</li>
<li>Market reaction: uncertain about the timeline</li>
<li>Supercharger network: Most automakers have adopted Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS). </li>
<li>Market share: Tesla’s vehicles market share has stabilized in North America and Europe but noticeably improved in China.</li>
<li>AI power: Musk still expects nearly 90,000 H100 clusters dedicated to training by the end of this year.</li>
<li>Energy storage deployment</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparing Tesla and Waymo:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to six SAE levels of driving automation (0 no automation, 1driver assistance, 2 partial automation, 3 conditional automation, 4 high automation, 5 full automation), Tesla’s FSD remains at level 2, while Waymo operates at level 4. </li>
<li>Tesla relies on cameras and AI while Waymo relies on heavy hardware (LiDAR, radar, cameras).</li>
<li>Waymo’s reliance on expensive hardware limits its ability to scale quickly ($ 200K per vehicle). Tesla aims to scale faster by leveraging its existing fleet to train its AI models. </li>
<li>Waymo has built trust with regulators by gradually deploying its vehicles, whileTesla faces regulatory hurdles particularly with the Cybercab.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This article argues that Data reflects our biases and values rather than providing an objective view of the world and data alone is insufficient for achieving superhuman AI. It offers three types of intelligence that are often overlooked in datasets: cultural intelligence, delusional intelligence, and subjective intelligence. </p>
<p>In my view, those are the gaps between AI and human. AI becomes human if those intelligence are acquired. However the question is, should AI become human first before becoming superhuman AI? It is true that human level is not skippable in the path to AGI? </p>
<p>Some interesting further discussion points implied by this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How can we better incorporate cultural intelligence into AI training datasets and algorithms?</p>
<p>Other than broadening data or documenting practices, what’s more interesting is to develop AI system that can identify and adapt to different cultural contexts</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the ethical implications of AI systems lacking delusional and subjective intelligence?</p>
<p>Be prone to perpetuating existing biases and discriminatory practices without subjective consideration.  Limit problem solving capabilities (? But creativity of LLM can be tuned by setting parameters). Not able to adapt to cultural nuances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are the limitations of relying solely on quantitative metrics in evaluating AI performance?</p>
<p>Lead to exclusion of crucial qualitative factors; incentivize the optimization of narrow objectives rather than broader well-being; not able to capture the complex and nuanced nature of human intelligence.</p>

<p>Interesting findings on model variability: 1) Significant performance variations when questions are rephrased or when only numerical values are altered. 2) Models demonstrate robustness to superficial changes (e.g., proper names) but are highly sensitive to numerical changes. </p>
<p>Interesting findings on model complexity and fragility: 1) Model performance deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases, revealing challenges with handling complexity, 2) Adding irrelevant but seemingly relevant clauses leads to a performance drop of up to 65% in some models.</p>
<p>Insights in reasoning: 1) The decline in performance suggests LLMs rely on pattern matching rather than genuine logical reasoning, 2) Models replicate training data patterns rather than solving problems from first principles.</p>

Indeed, AI has reshaped R&amp;D process especially in natural science and material science where structured search is required .e.g drug discovery, climatology, etc. However, scientists with different degree of expertise (top and bottom scientists) achieve drastically different productivity with AI, giving bottom scientists less benefits. This characteristic has some consequences and implications</p>
<ol>
<li>Resources are misallocated to less promising AI suggestions. Human innovation and creativity is not encouraged and cultivated.</li>
<li>Expertise is still required as AI only demonstrates its potential when complemented by human expertise. The judgment ability in leveraging AI’s potential is important.</li>

<p>The researchers define introspection as “acquiring knowledge that is not contained in or derived from training data but instead originates from internal states”.</p>
<p>They conducted interesting experiments: finetuning LLMs to predict properties of their own behavior in hypothetical scenarios. It turns out that a LLM can predict itself better than other models predicting it, even those models are trained on the same data pool.</p>
<p>Conclusion is suprising -  language models have knowledge about themselves that is neither contained in their training data nor inferable from it. The researchers developed a self-prediction training framework where models predict properties of their hypothetical responses.There is already LLM research areas in honesty, behaviors, etc. I believe this work is hugely contributing to these areas.</p>

<li><p>There is a serious commitment from enterprise to AI integration in business strategies</p>
</li>
<li><p>The top use cases for generative AI focus on enhancing productivity and efficiency. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Copilots (51% adoption)</li>
<li>Support Chatbots (31% adoption)</li>
<li>Enterprise Search + Retrieval (28% adoption)</li>
<li>Data Extraction + Transformation (27% adoption)</li>
<li>Meeting Summarization (24% adoption)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There’s a growing trend towards autonomous AI agents capable of managing complex processes independently. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Businesses are focused on tools that deliver measurable value (ROI) and industry-specific customization, rather than simply looking for the cheapest option. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Industry-specific, verticalized AI applications are gaining momentum, particularly in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare ($500 million in enterprise spending)</li>
<li>Legal ($350 million in enterprise spending)</li>
<li>Financial Services ($100 million in enterprise spending)</li>
<li>Media and Entertainment ($100 million in enterprise spending)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Companies prefer multi-model strategies. This has led to a decline in OpenAI’s dominance, while Anthropic is gaining market share.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant design pattern, with 51% adoption. Meanwhile, agentic architectures are emerging, now powering 12% of implementations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is a talent drought as AI engineering becoming more sophisticated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There’s a growing trend towards companies building their own AI solutions in-house.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Previously, in 2023, a large majority of enterprises (80%) relied on third-party vendors for their generative AI software</p>
</li>
<li><p>In 2024, the split between building and buying is almost even, with 47% of solutions developed internally and 53% sourced from vendors</p>
</li>
<li><p>This shift suggests a growing confidence among enterprises in their ability to develop and implement their own AI tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>while there’s a trend towards building in-house solutions, companies are not abandoning vendors entirely. The sources still highlight the importance of vendors, especially for companies lacking the resources or expertise for in-house development. The even split between building and buying suggests a hybrid approach is emerging, where companies strategically choose which solutions to develop internally and which to procure from vendors.</p>
