<p><em>This new <code>model.out_head</code> output layer has its <code>requires_grad</code> attribute set to <code>True</code> by default, which means that it’s the only layer in the model that will be updated during training. Technically, training the output layer we just added is sufficient. However, as I found in experiments, finetuning additional layers can noticeably improve the predictive performance of the finetuned model.</em> </p>
<p><strong>― Building A GPT-Style LLM Classifier From Scratch - Sebastian Raschka</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/building-a-gpt-style-llm-classifier">Link</a>] [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch06/01_main-chapter-code/ch06.ipynb">Github</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting questions addressed by Sebastian:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do we need to train all layers?</p>
<p>“For classification finetuning, it is not necessary to update all layers in an LLM. (The fewer weights we update, the faster the training will be because we don’t need to compute the gradients for these weights during backpropagation.)”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why finetuning the last token, not the first token?</p>
<p>“In contrast to BERT, GPT is a decoder-style model with a causal attention mask. This means the first token has no context information of any other token in the input. Only the last token has information about all other tokens.  Hence, if we want to use models like GPT for classification finetuning, we should focus on the last token to capture contextual information of all other input tokens.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>How does BERT compare to GPT performance-wise?</p>
<p>“The small GPT-2 model from the previous section and BERT performed similarly well on the spam classification dataset. “</p>
</li>
<li><p>Should we disable the causal mask?</p>
<p>“A core feature of the GPT architecture is the causal attention mask (different from BERT models or the original transformer architecture).  However, we could actually remove the causal mask during classification finetuning, which would allow us to finetune the first rather than the last token since future tokens will no longer be masked, and the first token can see all other tokens.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>What impact does increasing the model size have?</p>
<p>The prediction accuracy can improve significantly with larger models.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What improvements can we expect from LoRA?</p>
<p>Both full finetuning (all layers) and LoRA can result in the same test set performance. </p>
<p>“On the small model, LoRA is slightly slower since the additional overhead from adding LoRA layers may outweigh the benefits, but when training the larger 1.5 billion parameters model, LoRA trains 1.53x faster.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Padding or no padding? [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main/ch06/02_bonus_additional-experiments">experiments</a>]</p>
<p>“If we want to process data in batches during training or inference (this involves processing more than one input sequence at a time), we need to insert padding tokens to ensure that the training examples are of equal length. </p>
<p>In regular text generation tasks, padding doesn’t affect the model response since padding tokens are usually added to the right side, and due to the causal mask discussed earlier, these padding tokens don’t influence the other tokens. However, remember that we finetuned the last token, as discussed earlier. Since the padding tokens are to the left of this last token, the padding tokens may affect the result. “</p>

<li><p>Spaced Practice</p>
<p>Instead of cramming all the information at once, spaced practice consists of revisiting the material multiple times with breaks in between.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interleaving</p>
<p>This is about studying different topics in a sequence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Retrieval</p>
<p>This consists of bringing learned information from mid to long-term memory by recall or retrieval practices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Elaboration</p>
<p>Elaborative interrogation consists of asking and explaining why and how things work based on prior knowledge. In other words, it involves connecting new information to preexisting knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Concrete Example</p>
<p>When learning abstract concepts it was found that illustrating these topics with specific examples improves learning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dual Coding</p>
<p>Dual coding is about combining words with visuals. If you use relevant and helpful images in your notes, you may increase learning by remembering what you study with the help of these images.</p>

<p>Issues with AI at the organizational level and how to solve them.</p>
<ol>
<li>In many companies, there is little AI use and few productivity gains outside of narrow permitted use cases. That’s because AI use that boosts individual performance does not always translate to boosting organizational performance for a variety of reasons. To get organizational gains requires R&amp;D into AI use and you are largely going to have to do the R&amp;D yourself.</li>
<li>“Many key breakthrough innovations come not from central R&amp;D labs, but from people actually using products and tinkering with them to solve their own problems. “ (Prof. Eric von Hippel). As users are very motivated to make their own jobs easier with technology, they find ways to do so. The user advantage is especially big in experimenting with Generative AI because the systems are unreliable and have a jagged frontier of capability. People are experimenting with AI and finding it very useful. But they aren’t sharing their results with their employers.</li>

<p><em>In physics, we study how particles or systems’ units interact and evolve toward stable states. In machine learning, we study how neurons (or artificial neurons) interact to learn patterns directly from data.  The connection lies in energy minimization: both approaches define an energy function to describe the stability of a system, and the optimization of this function helps to find optimal configurations that correspond to useful patterns or memories.</em></p>
<p><em>Hopfield developed a network that recreates patterns using energy minimization, while Hinton expanded on this with the introduction of Boltzmann machines, statistical physics-based systems that learn to recognize and generate patterns, providing groundwork for modern machine learning.</em></p>

<p>“Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without malicious intent, simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can also inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, though to a lesser extent.

<p>Key business highlights: 1) Spotify’s new subscription plans - Spotify’s Audiobooks Access ($9.99&#x2F;month for 15 hours) and Basic (removing audiobooks from Premium) diversify its offerings, 2) Spotify is incorporating social-style discovery features, like Live Listening Parties and prompt-based AI playlists, but remains behind YouTube and Meta in algorithm sophistication and live content, 3) Spotify’s ad-supported ARPU is low (€1.15 vs. Meta’s $11.89 in Q2), limiting ad revenue potential. A new in-house creative agency may improve brand experiences but is challenging to scale profitably, 4) Spotify pivoted from broad podcasting investments to a case-by-case approach, now pushing video podcasts. </p>
<p>Competitiveness: 1) Hub Entertainment Research shows Spotify’s high ‘must-have’ appeal, with 75% of US users viewing it as “uncancellable.” This loyalty supports Spotify’s growing free cash flow and a valuation around 40 times Free Cash Flow (FCF) —placing it ahead of rivals like YouTube Music (100M subscribers) and Apple Music (estimated 110M by 2025), 2) Despite solid growth, Spotify’s reliance on licensed content and its still-limited ad revenue leave room for competition. While TikTok’s 1B+ users could funnel into TikTok Music, ByteDance recently announced it will close TikTok Music by November, focusing instead on promoting artists and streaming value within the main app—a potential competitive break for Spotify.</p>

<p>Hinton’s focus on end-to-end neural networks can be limiting, especially when considering the complexities of real-world problems that often require more structured and hybrid approaches.

<p><em>First, Waymo is using transformer-based foundation models for all stages of its self-driving pipeline: perception, prediction, and planning. Second, the whole system is trained end to end. During training, gradients from the behavior network propagate backwards to the perception network.</em> </p>
<p><em>So I see more similarities than differences in the evolution of Waymo and Tesla’s self-driving software. Both companies made little to no use of neural networks in their early systems. Both companies started using neural networks for perception in the late 2010s. And both companies only recently shifted to end-to-end architectures that used neural networks for all stages of the self-driving pipeline.</em></p>

<p>Tesla’s advantages compared to Waymo:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tesla already has millions of vehicles on the road, which could quickly deploy robotaxi software without the need for new hardware. </li>
<li>Tesla relies on cost-effective, camera-based perception without expensive sensors like lidar, which Waymo uses. This could lower Tesla’s per-vehicle cost and allow it to expand more rapidly if autonomy is achieved.</li>
<li>Tesla’s transition to a full, end-to-end neural network approach for perception, prediction, and planning has improved FSD’s ability to handle complex driving situations without manual coding for specific scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tesla’s disadvantages compared to Waymo:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tesla hasn’t deployed a fully driverless car yet, while Waymo has offered driverless rides since 2020.</li>
<li>Tesla would need extensive infrastructure to maintain a robotaxi network (for charging, cleaning, and repairs) which it currently lacks. Building this up in cities nationwide would take time, resources, and logistical planning.</li>
<li>Tesla’s camera-only approach may struggle in certain conditions (e.g., low visibility), which lidar could handle better.</li>

<p><em>Key Contribution of AI to Robotics:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Improved Reasoning and Planning</strong>: Large language models, like those developed by OpenAI and Google, are enabling robots to interpret high-level commands, understand contextual instructions, and execute complex, multi-step tasks. This is particularly valuable in dynamic environments where robots must adapt to unforeseen changes and make real-time decisions.</em> </li>
<li><em><strong>Enhanced Visual and Motor Coordination</strong>: The integration of generative AI with visual and motor feedback systems allows robots to translate visual inputs into precise motor actions. This enables robots to perform tasks such as picking and placing objects with greater accuracy and efficiency, even in environments that are constantly changing.</em> </li>
<li><em><strong>Natural Language Interfaces</strong>: AI-driven natural language interfaces are making it easier for users to interact with robots using everyday language rather than programming code. This democratization of robotics makes it accessible to non-technical users, paving the way for broader adoption across industries.</em> </li>
<li><em><strong>Predictive Maintenance</strong>: AI models analyze real-time data from robots to predict potential malfunctions, enabling proactive maintenance that minimizes costly downtime and enhances operational efficiency.</em></li>

<p>Q1: I’m curious how you rebuilt or rediscover momentum after pivoting in a professional or personal sense in terms of your values.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have unbelievable greatest technological wave ever, so it’s a great time to be starting out your career. You are going to be flooded with opportunities for the next few years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q2: How do you think AI’s role will be in tackling sort of inequalities in education and health care and legal stuff?</p>
<ul>
<li>It should reduce inequality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q3: Subscription model could be a barrier for startup and small businesses, do you think OpenAI would explore alternative monetization strategy that could include free API access, perhaps supported by advertising or other methods, to foster innovation in the future?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sam hates ads in general.  Ads + AI is uniquely unsettling to him. He likes the simplicity of OpenAI’s model, which is they make great AI and people pay them for it, and they just do the best they can for people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q4: Does the increasing competitors change the way you are evolving for the next products?</p>
<ul>
<li>They are just trying to figure out the next paradigm and the next great idea. They don’t pay much attention to the market share though they pay at least attention to competitors to maybe get inspiration.</li>
<li>Sam’s hope is that every year, they do something amazing that people thought was impossible. Once you know that something is possible and roughly how to do it, it always gets copied quickly. That’s not the hard part. The hard part is figuring out what it is and doing it first when you don’t know it’s possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q5: what do you think the ideal public general education curriculum on AI should look like and what does the average person need to know about AI in the next 5-10 years?</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer science major or at least some courses. Being able to train a GPT-2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q6: Can you share what’s coming next after transformers? Then the second question is what do you think most entrepreneurs and VCs are getting wrong about the future of AI?</p>
<ul>
<li>Most entrepreneurs don’t bet on AI models are going to be massively better so that’s why there is meme that “OpenAI kills my startup”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q7: How much exposure does OpenAI and the AI movement have to energy constraints? And what do you think the role is of founders have to play in addressing these concerns?  </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s necessary to Sam to drive tech abundance from those two key inputs - energy and AI.</li>

<p>Adaptive learning skill is important but might not correlated with seniority or experience. Employees with this capability can quickly become knowledgeable about the products and are able to learn and adjust on the fly.</p>
<p>The article suggests that managers or companies could be given a snapshot of how many of salespeople are adaptive learners without singling out any individual. and they could tell which tasks require adaptive learning skills and which don’t and allow them to choose. This should be done in an anonymous way. </p>
<p>No matter whether what’s been proposed in this article is applicable or ethical. The idea of adaptive learning is kind of new to me, and it inspires me to further think about whether this skill is learnable and teachable, and think about whether there is any other secret skills in sales. </p>

<p><strong>New Rules for Teamwork - Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2024/09/new-rules-for-teamwork">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Develop an Operating System</p>
<p>OS means building blocks for the way team members collaborate, create change, and support one another. Effective operating systems vary widely, depending on the needs and norms of the organization. What they all have in common is that they set out a view of how teams create value, what teams are supposed to achieve, the technical skills each team member is expected to contribute, the processes by which the work will be managed, and the cultural norms and mindsets of constructive collaboration that will guide behavior. </p>
<p>Suggestions: hold kickoffs, conduct one on ones, and take stock of progress using retrospectives, are the three practices as a foundations of team OS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Invest in Active, Real-Time Measurement</p>
<p>To make teamwork scientific, organizations need to be able to measure the outcomes of their actions and determine how changes in the inputs affect results. </p>
<p>Suggestion: define what constitutes success.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a System for Continuous Improvement and Innovation</p>
<p>Teams today have new forms of technology and data collection at their disposal to help them self-correct while projects are underway. e.g. support colleagues to discuss what could have been done better; look at the patterns across teams to identify improvements and share best practices, particularly with regard to the rapid adoption of new technologies such as GenAI.</p>
<p>Suggestions: Identify the metrics that matter most (shift-changeover time, perhaps), hypothesize which actions could improve performance in those areas (preassigned workstations, perhaps), and embed technologies in the operating system (a smart-planning app, perhaps) to enable continuous improvement. Continuous improvement can occur only when all perspectives are considered and all teams have access to a centralized knowledge repository. Finally, it may be useful to set up a center of excellence, staffed with full-time employees with experience in analytics and operating system design.</p>

<p><strong>Why Leadership Teams Fail - Harvard Business Review</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2024/09/why-leadership-teams-fail">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was reading while thinking about my team and neighbor teams. I find this article very useful. </p>
<p>A critical factor in organizational success: the health of their leadership team. There are three main patterns of dysfunction: Shark Tanks, Petting Zoos, and Mediocracies. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Shark Tanks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A leadership team marked by hyper-competition, political maneuvering, and infighting. Members prioritize personal agendas over collective goals, leading to toxic and combative dynamics.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes: Lack of clear direction or boundaries from the CEO or team leader. Failure to address self-serving behaviors early on. Absence of behavioral norms that encourage collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Signs: Team members engage in power struggles outside of meetings. One-on-one discussions with the CEO on issues that should be resolved in team settings. Meetings turn into battlegrounds, with frequent arguments and difficulty reaching consensus. Executives bad-mouth each other, form alliances, or resist decisions after they’ve been made.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prevention:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear Expectations: Leaders should explicitly define which behaviors are acceptable and unacceptable. Set boundaries around how competition should be managed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Confront Self-Serving Behaviors: Address aggressive or toxic behaviors directly with individuals. Remove those unwilling to align with the team’s goals, even if they’re high performers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Role Modeling: The CEO or team leader must model collaborative behaviors and ensure transparency in communication to prevent political games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regular Feedback: Reinforce positive behaviors and correct negative ones through continuous feedback. Implement 360-degree reviews to track team behavior and performance alignment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Petting Zoos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A leadership team that avoids conflict to maintain harmony. Vigorous debate is sacrificed, and members prioritize getting along over pushing for the best ideas, leading to complacency and poor decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes: Overemphasis on collaboration and mutual trust, leading to conflict avoidance. Team members are too deferential, fearing that disagreements might disrupt the team’s harmony. Leaders may unknowingly encourage this avoidance by stressing harmony over debate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Signs: Meetings lack critical debate, and discussions feel muted and lacking in emotional intensity. Team members engage in performance theater, focusing on positive news while downplaying problems. Decisions are made by consensus without sufficient evaluation or challenge. Leaders avoid holding one another accountable for poor performance, reluctant to disrupt the status quo.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prevention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage Debate: Leaders should foster a culture of constructive conflict where members feel safe to challenge each other’s ideas. A foundation of trust and psychological safety is key.</li>
<li>Promote Data-Driven Discussion: Ensure discussions are rooted in facts, using shared data to spur debate and avoid personal conflict. This encourages neutral, objective decision-making.</li>
<li>Monitor Meeting Dynamics: Leaders should track participation and the quality of discussion during meetings, encouraging team members to speak up and challenge ideas more openly.</li>
<li>Redefine Consensus: Teams must understand that consensus does not mean avoiding conflict but making informed decisions after rigorous debate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mediocracies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A leadership team marked by complacency, lacking the drive or skills to achieve high performance. Collaboration and competition are both underemphasized, and the team fails to meet the organization’s needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes: Long periods of success that breed complacency. Poor alignment between the team’s skills and the changing demands of the business. A divided team, where some members prefer competition while others favor collaboration, leading to inconsistent and ineffective efforts. A leader’s failure to adapt to changing market conditions or internal challenges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Signs: Team members operate in silos, with little collaboration between departments or units. Decision-making is slow, and there is a lack of accountability for performance. The team focuses on past achievements rather than future goals, with little ambition or drive for improvement. The team struggles with stagnation, missed opportunities, and duplicated efforts due to poor coordination.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prevention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild the Team: Leaders may need to replace members who are not fit for their roles or who lack the motivation or skills needed to lead effectively. New hires should be chosen not just for their skills but also for their alignment with the company’s purpose and values.</li>
<li>Promote Balance: Strike a balance between competition and collaboration by hiring individuals with complementary skills and styles (e.g., planners and visionaries alongside hard-nosed executors).</li>
<li>Clear Roles and Expectations: Define where collaboration is expected (e.g., across departments) and where competition might be useful (e.g., in individual market decisions). Ensure everyone understands their responsibilities and how their performance contributes to broader goals.</li>
<li>Challenge the Status Quo: Continuously push the team to innovate and grow by setting ambitious goals and holding team members accountable for driving performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>This essay aligns with our thinking that while you acknowledge the risks and share concerns over idealistic promises, you also recognize the challenges inherent in building AGI. It reflects an approach to AI that balances ambition with caution, and providing perspectives of how to articulate a vision for AI tat remains both ambitious and grounded.</p>
<p>Interesting point: As AI reaches near-universal superiority, the economy may need to adapt fundamentally. Potential solutions range from universal basic income (UBI) to entirely new economic frameworks. Perhaps AIs might manage resources and distribute them according to value systems derived from human input, but such proposals raise ethical and practical concerns. The author hints that the economic transformation required could be as drastic as past societal shifts (e.g. from hunting-gathering to agriculture), suggesting that humanity will have to experiment and iterate to find sustainable models that protect against exploitation or dystopia.</p>
<p>Overall, the author believes that the core human values such as fairness, cooperation, and autonomy have a natural, most ‘’overdetermined’ appeal, and will often lead toward democracy, rule of law, and enlightenment ideals - a trajectory that AI as a catalyst could accelerate by making the path to this “good world” more tangible. While the vision seems intuitive and inspiring to many, it may still appear fantastical or undesirable to others. Even so, the author finds a unique beauty in striving for it, suggesting that our intrinsic human impulses toward collaboration and justice make this vision both plausible and worth pursuing. </p>

<p><strong>Learning vs Retrieval: The Role of In-Context Examples in Regression with LLMs</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04318">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper explores in-context learning (ICL) mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), focusing on the balance between knowledge retrieval and learning from in-context examples in regression tasks. It reports that LLMs can learn from regression examples of realistic datasets in-context, extending previous work on synthetic data to more practical scenarios.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to this kind of experiments and studies, because I was suspicious about applying LLM on structured data.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The issue might stem from the nature of LLMs, which are designed to generate plausible responses based on patterns in the data they’ve seen, rather than to <em>know</em> anything in the traditional sense. They don’t have an internal mechanism to differentiate truth from fabrication, so as they scale up, they produce more complex, yet not necessarily more accurate, answers. This makes them better at appearing smart, but less reliable overall—a quality that philosophers like Mike Hicks rightly criticize as “bullshitting.”</p>
<p>From a user perspective, it underscores the need for critical thinking when engaging with AI models through prompt engineering. Just because an LLM provides a well-phrased response doesn’t mean it’s accurate. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>o1—like previous LLMs—is sensitive to the probability of examples and tasks, performing better and requiring fewer “thinking tokens” in high-probability settings than in low-probability ones.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although optimized for reasoning, o1 still exhibits probability-based limitations tied to its autoregressive origins, implying that a complete departure from these influences has not been fully achieved.</p>

<p>Astute RAG is designed to better combine internal and external information through an interactive consolidation mechanism (i.e., identifying consistent passages, detecting conflicting information in them, and filtering out irrelevant information).</p>

<p><strong>Differential Transformer - Microsoft Research</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diff Transformer amplifies attention to relevant context while canceling noise, resulting in outperforming standard Transformers in multiple areas such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reducing activation outliers, as shown in the experiments. </p>
<p>The key innovation is a differential attention mechanism that calculates attention scores by subtracting two separate softmax attention maps. This subtraction cancels out irrelevant attention, promoting sparser, more accurate focus on important information, similar to noise-canceling techniques.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Diffusion Guided Language Modeling</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04220">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Controllable language modeling refers to techniques that allow users to guide or control specific attributes of the generated text from a language model (LM). These attributes can include factors like sentiment, toxicity, formality, or any other desired linguistic or stylistic feature. The primary challenge is ensuring that generated content aligns with specific requirements without compromising fluency, coherence, or overall quality of the text.</p>
<p>Diffusion models are excellent for controllable generation. They generate data in a multi-step process, gradually refining noise into coherent content. This incremental approach allows for fine-grained control at various stages of the generation. By manipulating the process at specific steps, you can guide the output more effectively toward desired characteristics (such as sentiment, style, or tone). In contrast, auto-regressive models like GPT generate text token by token in a one-shot manner, making it harder to impose controls without affecting fluency.</p>
<p>DGLM could refine language model generation because it integrates the fluency of auto-regressive language models (like GPT) with the flexibility of diffusion models. This flexibility is realized by employing Plug-and-Play with Linear Classifiers in the Sentence-T5 latent space to guide the diffusion process towards generating proposals with desired attributes. </p>

<p><strong>On the Diagram of Thought</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10038">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researchers from Tsinghua University, led by Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, introduced Diagram of Thought (DoT), designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. </p>
<p>The limitation of CoT is that it processes information in a straight line which does not reflect the way of how humans think. The limitation of ToT or GoT is that they are computationally expensive and challenging to implement within a single LLM.</p>
<p>DoT addresses these limitations by modeling reasoning as the construction of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) within a single LLM. This DAG comprises nodes representing: 1) Propositions: Initial and refined ideas generated throughout the reasoning process, 2) Critiques: Evaluations of propositions, identifying errors or inconsistencies. 3) Refinements: Improved propositions based on critiques. 4) Verifications: Confirmation of valid propositions.</p>
<p>Two key crucial aspect of DoT framework: 1) it leverages auto-regressive next-token prediction with role specific tokens to manage reasoning process within a single LLM, 2) it has strong foundation in math logic - Topos Theory, ensuring logical consistency and soundness in reasoning process.</p>

<p>Dunning-Kruger effect is named after psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger, who first described this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">phenomenon in 1999</a>. It reveals a troubling mismatch between perception and reality. Those who know little often lack the self-awareness to recognize their limitations. Conversely, experts may be acutely aware of the vastness of their field, leading them to undervalue their own expertise.</p>

<p>A study of malicious services powered by LLM ‘Malla’ in the underground marketplaces. (When it comes to AI, everywhere has gaps to bridge lol). Interesting mysteries to uncover: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Who are the pivotal players within the Malla ecosystem? </p>
<p>The Malla ecosystem comprises vendors who create malicious LLM services, users who exploit these services, and platforms that facilitate their operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How is Malla orchestrated and monetized? </p>
<p>Malla services generate revenue through direct user transactions, often accepting cryptocurrencies, with some vendors reporting substantial earnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What techniques did miscreants deploy to exploit LLMs and build up Mallas?</p>
<p>Miscreants utilize techniques like jailbreak prompts to bypass LLM restrictions and abuse public APIs to generate harmful content.</p>
