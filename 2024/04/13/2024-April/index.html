<p><em>You don’t get paid for working hard.</em></p>
<p><em>You get paid based on how hard you are to replace.</em></p>

<p>What he’s saying is so true - Don’t work so hard and end up losing yourself. I’m glad I followed this guy.</p>

<p><em>There is a popular saying on Wall Street. While IPO means Initial Public Offering, it also means “It’s Probably Overpriced” (coined by Ken Fisher).</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t invest in brand-new IPOs during the first six months. Why? Shares tend to underperform out of the gate for new public companies and often bottom around the tail end of the lock-up period, with anticipation of selling pressure from insiders.  It’s also critical to gain insights from the first few quarters to form an opinion about the management team.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Do they forecast conservatively?</em></li>
<li><em>Do they consistently beat their guidance?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If not, it might be a sign that they are running out of steam and may have embellished their prospects in the S-1. But we need several quarters to understand the dynamic at play.</em></p>

<p><em>As Columbia Business School professor Rita McGrath points out, it’s about identifying “the strategic inflection points” at which the cost of waiting exceeds to cost acting — in other words, identifying the most strategic point to enter a market or adopt a technology, balancing the risks and opportunities based on market readiness, technological maturity and organizational capacity.</em></p>
<p><em>This speaks to the growing adoption of agile, “act, learn, build” approaches over traditional “prove-plan-execute” orientations. The popularity of techniques like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/1995/07/discovery-driven-planning">discovery-driven planning</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">the lean startup</a>, and other agile approaches and propagated this philosophy in which, rather than building bullet-proof business cases, one makes small steps, learning from them, and deciding whether to invest further.</em></p>

<p>It’s a very good read. It provided real world business examples which happened recently for the 6 strategic concepts: Borrow someone’s road, partner with a third party, reveal your strategy, be good, let the competition go, adopt small scale attacks. </p>

<p><em>Gig work is structured in a way that strengthens the alignment between customers and companies and deepens the divide between customers and workers, leading to systemic imbalances in its service triangle.</em> </p>
<p><em>Bridging the customer-worker divide can result in higher customer trust and platform commitment, both by the customer and the worker.</em> </p>
<p><em>To start, platforms need to increase transparency, reduce information asymmetry, and price their services clearly, allowing customers to better understand what they are paying for rather than only seeing an aggregated total at the end of the transaction. This, in turn, can help customers get used to the idea that if workers are to be paid fairly, gig work cannot be a free or low-cost service.</em></p>
<p><em>Gig workers might be working through an app, but they are not robots, and they deserve to be treated respectfully and thoughtfully. So tip well, rate appropriately, and work together to make the experience as smooth as possible both for yourself and for workers.</em></p>

<p> “The power of an agentic workflow is the fact that you can have multiple agents all with different roles different backgrounds different personas different tools, working together and iterating on a task.”</p>
<p>“GPT 3.5” with an agentic workflow actually outperforms GPT 4.”</p>
<p>“<strong>Reflection</strong>: reflect on the output you gave me, find a way to improve it, then return another result or return the improvements. <strong>Tool use</strong>: you can custom code tools, such as web scraping tool, SEC lookup tool, complex math library, etc. You can give a bunch of tools that the LLM didn’t previously have, you just describe what the tool does and the LLM can actually choose when to use the tool.”</p>
<p>“<strong>Planning</strong>: give the LLM the ability to think more slowly, to plan steps. <strong>Multi-agent collaboration</strong> (autogen and crew ai): very emerging technology, with enough QA, testing, and iterations you usually can make agents behave what you need, and the results are phenomenal. Not only do you get the benefits of having the LLM essentially reflect with different personalities or different roles, but you can actually have different models powering different agents. And so you get the benefit of the reflection based on the quality of each model.  “</p>

<p>Reflection and Tool use are robust technology. Planning and Multi-agent collaboration are emerging technology.</p>
