<p><em>A topological qubit is a system that encodes data into the properties of pairs of non-Abelian anyons by physically swapping them around with each other in space. Non-Abelian anyons is desirable component for holding and manipulating information in quantum computers because of its resilience which is rooted in math from the field of topology - the study of spatial relationships and geometry that hold true even when shapes are distorted.</em></p>
<p><strong>―  The Holy Grail of Quantum Computing, Weird</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-holy-grail-of-quantum-computing/">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researcher from Google and Quantinuum demonstrated a mechanism needed for a component called a topological qubit, which should promise a means to maintain and manipulate information encoded into quantum states more robustly than existing hardware designs. Topological qubits store and work with digital information in non-Abelian anyons, which retain a sort of “memory” of their past movement that enables the representation of binary data. While physicists previous proved the existence of non-Abelian anyons, Quantinuum’s and Google’s work are the first to demonstrate their signature feature, memory of movement. However, people disagreed that topological qubit has been created because the object was too fragile for practical use and cannot reliably manipulate information to achieve practical quantum computing. Delivering a practical topological qubit will require all kinds of studies of non-Abelian anyons and the math underpinning their quirky behavior. Technological breakthrough can be expected after incremental progress.</p>
<p>Google Quantum Al’s paper published in May 2023 is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05954-4">here</a> and no I’m not going to read this theoretical physics paper :)</p>

<p><em>Apple’s rivals, such as Samsung, are gearing up to launch a new kind of “AI smartphone” next year. Counterpoint estimated more than 100 million AI-focused smartphones would be shipped in 2024, with 40 percent of new devices offering such capabilities by 2027.</em></p>
<p><em>Optimizing LLMs to run on battery-powered devices has been a growing focus for AI researchers. Academic papers are not a direct indicator of how Apple intends to add new features to its products, but they offer a rare glimpse into its secretive research labs and the company’s latest technical breakthroughs.</em></p>
<p><em>“Our work not only provides a solution to a current computational bottleneck but also sets a precedent for future research,” wrote Apple’s researchers in the conclusion to their paper. “We believe as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, approaches like this work will be essential for harnessing their full potential in a wide range of devices and applications.”</em></p>

<p>Apple is developing solutions to running LLM or other AI models directly on a customer’s iPhone. The published paper is titled “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11514.pdf">LLM in a Flash</a>“. Apple’s focus is different from Microsoft’s and Google’s focus of developing Chatbots and GenAI over the Internet from cloud computing platform. I think the smartphone market would be revived and customer experience would be largely changed in the future with this potential vision of personalized and mobile AI agents &#x2F; assistants. If this personalized little AI agent can learn everything about a person from childhood to adult, can we eventually get a perfect adult mind? It reminds me of what Alan Turing said about AI: </p>
<p><em>“Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.”</em></p>

<p><em>Since the beginning of 2017, China has chalked up more than 18 million EV sales, nearly half the world’s total and over four times more than the US, according to BloombergNEF data. By 2026, the research group projects that over 50% of all new passenger vehicle sales in China will be electric, compared to a little over a quarter in the US.</em></p>
<p><em>The growth of the network was both a result of state planning and private enterprise. Giant state-owned companies like State Grid Corp. of China were given mandates to roll out chargers, while private companies like Qingdao TGOOD Electric Co. jumped at the chance to build charging posts—in part to lay early claim to the best locations. Baidu’s mapping software—the Chinese equivalent of Google Maps—has them all integrated, delivering constant reminders of where to go. Payment is typically via an app or the ubiquitous WeChat platform.</em></p>
<p><em>Demand for new lithium-ion batteries is expected to increase about five-fold between 2023 and 2033, according to Julia Harty, an energy transition analyst at FastMarkets. Meeting that will require recycling as well as mining.</em></p>

<p>I haven’t been back to China for 3 years, and last time (2021) there are just a few EVs. Maybe a few years later there are only a few gasoline cars left on the roads. The transition from gasoline cars to electrical vehicles won’t be fast but the peak of sales for gasoline cards is coming soon in China. </p>

<p><em>In its complaint, The Times said it approached Microsoft and OpenAI in April to raise concerns about the use of its intellectual property and explore “an amicable resolution,” possibly involving a commercial agreement and “technological guardrails” around generative A.I. products.</em></p>
<p><em>The lawsuit could test the emerging legal contours of generative A.I. technologies — so called for the text, images and other content they can create after learning from large data sets — and could carry major implications for the news industry.</em> </p>
<p><em>“If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill,” the complaint reads. It adds, “Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”</em></p>

<p>There is always a group of people who are positively working on changing the world while another group of people who are suspicious and concerned. Every lawsuit in AI field allows us to hold on and reflect whether we are doing the right things and how to fix the problems along the way of innovation and development. It is a good point that if intellectual property of journalism is not well-protect while AI is still in its immature stage with a lot of mistakes in text learning and generation, then less journalism will be produced, and less truths will be revealed and documented. The damage to the society is enormous.</p>

This culminated in a $1Bn investment from Microsoft, marking the beginning of a key strategic relationship, but complicating the company’s organizational structure and incentives.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This article (Quick Essay: A Short History of OpenAI) reviewed the history of OpenAl from 2015 when it’s founded to 2023 when Sam was once fired. A crucial development happened in 2018 when the company first introduced the foundational architecture of GPT in a paper “Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training”. This leads to the flagship product of the company - ChatGPT, in Nov 2022. In 2019 OpenAl transited from nonprofit to a “capped-profit” model. This novel convoluted corporate structure led to conflicting motivations and incentives within the company and it latter raised board’s concern about company’s commitment to safety.</p>
<p>Sam Altman was fired on Nov 17, 2023. On Nov 19, 2023, OpenAl hired former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as its interim CEO. Meanwhile Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that they would hired Sam to lead a new Al department. On Nov 20, 2023, Nearly all 800 OpenAl employees signed a letter calling for the resignation of the company’s board and the return of Altman as CEO. On Nov 21, 2023, Sam returned as CEO of OpenAl.</p>
<p>One story in 2020: Two of the lead Al developers Amodei and his sister Daniela left OpenAl in late 2020 to launch Anthropic over concerns the company was moving too quickly to commercialize its technology. Anthropic was founded aiming to develop more safer and trustworthy model and it has billions invested from Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Zoom, etc.</p>
<p>Since Sam was rehired, the questions about neglecting Al safety has been quieted, and new board members appear to be more focused on profitability. There is no doubt of OpenAl’s capability of profitably scaling ChatGPT, but it should raise doubts about whether OpenAl is still committing to its purpose in the future. </p>
<p>Sutskever was recruited to OpenAl from Google in 2015 by Elon Musk, who describes him as “the linchpin for OpenAl being successful”. A tweet from Greg Brockman confirms that Ilya was a key figure in Altman’s removal. But Sutskever also a signee calling Sam back to CEO. He later said he deeply regret his participation in the board’s actions.</p>
