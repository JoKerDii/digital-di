<p><strong>―  “Lean Analytics, Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes people who are doing hard data work usually forget to step back and look at the big picture. This is a common mistake because we can definitely go from scientific data analysis to actionable insight for making better business decision. But we need to have some additional thoughts about whether the decision is a global optima or it’s just local due to the limited sample, restricted project goal, or restricted team scope.</p>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When I decided to end my voluntary immersion in the driver community, I could not shake the feeling that the depersonalization of app workers is a feature, not a bug, of an economic model born of and emboldened by transformations that are underway across the global economy. This includes increasingly prevalent work arrangements characterized by weak employer-worker relations (independent contracting), strong reliance on technology (algorithmic management, platform-mediated communication), and social isolation (no coworkers and limited customer interactions).</em></p>
<p><em>As forces continue to erode traditional forms of identity support, meaningful selfdefinition at work will increasingly rely on how we collectively use and misuse innovative technologies and business models.</em><br><em>For example, how can companies deploy algorithmic management in a way that doesn’t threaten and depersonalize workers? How can focusing on the narratives that underlie and animate identities help workers reimagine what they really want and deserve out of a career coming out of the pandemic and the Great Resignation? Will increasingly immersive and realistic digital environments like the metaverse function as identity playgrounds for workers in the future? How will Web3 broadly, and the emergence of novel forms of organizing specifically (e.g., decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs), affect the careers, connections, and causes that are so important to workers? What role can social media platforms, online discussion forums, and other types of virtual water coolers play in helping independent workers craft and sustain a desirable work identity? In short, how can we retain the human element in the face of increasingly shrewd resource management tactics?”</em></p>
<p><strong>― “Dehumanization is a Feature of Gig Work, Not a Bug”, Harvard Business Review, The Year in Tech 2024</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me that last year when I was on vacation in LA, I’ve talked to a driver worked for both Lyft and Uber in LA. He complained Lyft’s route recommendation algorithm is shitty, not helpful at all, a waste of time, while Uber is better in comparison. At that time I realized how important it is to strengthen employer worker relations and gather feedback from workers or clients on the product improvement.<br>This is a great article where the author raises his concerns of dehumanization of workers in the future. While technology is advancing and economy is transforming, we don’t expect people to forget who they are in their daily basis work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bringing a new technology to market presents a chicken-or-egg problem: The product needs a supply of complementary offerings, but the suppliers and complementors don’t exist yet, and no entrepreneur wants to throw their lot in with a technology that isn’t on the market yet.</p>
<p>There are two ways of “solving” this problem. First, you can time the market, and wait until the ecosystem matures— though you risk waiting a long time. Second, you can drive the market, or supply all the necessary inputs and complements yourself.</p>
<p><strong>― “Does Elon Musk Have a Strategy?”, Harvard Business Review, The Year in Tech 2024</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are two examples. To drive the market, Musk supplies both electric vehicles and charging stations. Zuckerberg proposed the concept of metaverse and changed his company’s name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where Musk’s Wall Street critics might say he’s weakest. Many of his businesses don’t articulate a clear logic, which is demonstrated by the unpredictable way these businesses ultimately reach solutions or products.</p>
<p>Musk has spelled out some of his prior logic in a set of “Master Plans,” but most of the logical basis for exactly how he will succeed remains ambiguous. But this isn’t necessarily Musk’s fault or due to any negligence per se: When pursuing new technologies, particularly ones that open up a new market, there is no one who can anticipate the full set of possibilities of what that technology will be able to do (and what it will not be able to do).</p>
<p><strong>― “Does Elon Musk Have a Strategy?”, Harvard Business Review, The Year in Tech 2024</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elon is interesting, but I have to say that we human need this type of person to leap to the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What could he possibly want with Twitter? The thing is, over the last decade, the technological landscape has changed, and how and when to moderate speech has become a critical problem-and an existential problem for social media companies. In other words, moderating speech has looked more and more like the kind of big, complex strategic problem that captures Musk’s interest.</em></p>
<p><strong>― “Does Elon Musk Have a Strategy?”, Harvard Business Review, The Year in Tech 2024</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great article which profiles Elon Musk specifically in his strategies and vision. It answered my question confusing me for two years: what was Musk thinking on buying Twitter? The answer is: Musk’s vision is not in pursuit of a specific type of solution but is in pursuit of a specific type of problem. If we go back to 2016, Igor as a CEO of Disney decided not to buy Twitter because he looked at Twitter as the solution: a global distribution platform, while concerned the quality of speech on it is a problem. Musk was looking for challenges and complexities while Igor was preventing them and looking for solutions.</p>

<p><em>“For active learning, the thing is it truly needs a problem. It needs a problem that requires it. It is very hard to do research about the capability of active learning if you don’t have a task. You will come up with an artificial task, get good results, but not really convince anyone. “, “Active learning will actually arrive with the problem that requires it to pop up.”― Ilya</em></p>
<p><em>“To build an AGI, I think it’s going to be Deep Learning plus some ideas, and self-play would be one of these ideas. Self-play has such properties that can surprise us in truly novel ways. Almost all self-play systems produce surprising behaviors that we didn’t expect. They are creating solutions to problems.”, “Not just random surprise but to find the surprising solution to a problem.”― Ilya</em></p>
<p><em>“Transferring from simulation to the real world is definitely possible and it’s been exhibited many times by many different groups. It’s been especially successful in vision. Also OpenAI in the summer has demonstrated robot hand which was trained entirely in simulation. “, “The policy that it learned in simulation was trained to be very adaptive. So adaptive that when you transfer if could very quickly adapt to the physical world.”― Ilya</em></p>
<p><em>“The real world that I would imagine is one where humanity are like the board members of a company where the AGI is the CEO. The picture I would imagine is you have some kind of different entities, countries or cities, and the people who live there vote for what the AGI that represents them should do. You could have multiple AGIs, you would have an AGI for a city, for a country, and it would be trying to in effects take the democratic process to the next level.” “(And the board can always fire the CEO), press the reset button, re-randomize the parameters.”― Ilya</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s definitely possible to build AI system which will want to be controlled by their humans.”, “It will be possible to program an AGI to design it in such a way that it will have a similar deep drive that it will be delighted to fulfill, and the drive will be to help humans flourish.”― Ilya</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t know if most people are good. I think that when it really counts, people can be better than we think.”― Ilya</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I watched Lex’s interview with Sam Altman uploaded on March 18, 2024, and an older interview with Ilya Sutskever happened 3 years ago. Elon’s lawsuit against OpenAI frustrated Sam but Sam is optimistic about the future and everything he is going to release in the next few months. Ilya’s interview is more interesting to me because he talked a lot about vision, tech, philosophy in Deep Learning. It’s impressive that he had such thoughts 3 years ago. </p>
