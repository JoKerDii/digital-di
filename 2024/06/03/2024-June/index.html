<p>PayPal hired Mark Grether who was head of Uber’s ad business to lead the initiative of an ad network. </p>
<p>Costco’s membership fees declined from 86% to 50% of the its operating profit. It has shown economies of scale and benefits from a more favorable revenue mix.</p>
<p>Salesforce’s revenue grew 11% to $9.1B, missing Wall Street estimates by $20M. Current Remaining Performance Obligations - the best indicator of future growth - rose 10%, missing estimates of 12%. The slowing growth is partially due to broader macroeconomic challenges and internal execution issues. Salesforce Data Cloud is contributing to 25% of the deals valued above $1M, indicating it’s well-positioned to benefit from AI boom.</p>
<p>Live Nation has caused such widespread outrage in 2022 Taylor Swift Eras Tour ticket sales because fans faced technical glitches and exorbitant fees. Live Nation was accused of locking venues into exclusive deals and bullying artists into using its services, which caused higher ticket prices through service and convenience fees. Live Nation is under scrutiny by the government. It is forced to divest Ticketmaster (acquired in 2020). Fans &#x2F; artists are expecting increased competition in live music industry and lower prices, and a smoother ticket buying experience.</p>

<p>AI agents as the next frontier could make traveling personalized. The key metrics to define their success are 1) gross bookings, 2) nights booked, 3) average daily rate (ADR), 4) revenue per available room (RevPAR), customer acquisition cost (CAC). </p>
<p>The largest travel companies (online travel agencies and rentals and hotel chains) are Booking Holdings, Airbnb, Expedia, Marriott, and Hilton.</p>
<p>Highlights: 1) Booking Holdings (operating as an OTA): CEO Glenn Fogel envisions AI enhancing connected trips (single booking that include multiple travel elements such as flights, accommodations, car rentals, etc), 2) Airbnb exceeded expectations on both revenue and profitability in Q1 due to its robust international expansion, while slowing down the growth in North America. Airbnb is aiming to create an AI powered concierge to elevate the overall Airbnb experiences, 3) Expedia (operating as an OTA): Expedia is currently facing challenges of transition and adjustment: Vrbo vacation rental platform integration into Expedia platform is slower than expected. And it’s also facing challenges in attracting and retaining customers in its B2C segment. A new CEO Ariane Gorin was recently appointed to help navigate through these challenges. 4) Marriott (operating as booking platform): Marriott has developed Homes &amp; Villas tool that allows users to search for vacation rentals using language. A slow-down RevPAR in North America has been observed which indicates a shift in consumer preferences towards international destinations and alternative accommodations. Its brand reputation, loyalty program and focus on group&#x2F;business travel remain strong. 5) Hilton: has strong emphasis on personalization and loyalty programs though facing headwinds in the US. CEO Chris Nassetta envisions AI-powered tools to address guest concerns in real time.</p>

<p><em>From graphics rendering, gaming and media, cloud computing and crypto, Nvidia’s chips have led the way in each of these past innovation cycles as it saw its GPU applications expand over the last 2 decades. And now it is getting ready to advance the next industrial revolution, that will be powered by AI.</em></p>
<p><em>Some industry experts believe that<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-a-shifting-ai-chip-market-will-shape-nvidias-future-f0c256b1"> 20% of the demand for AI chips next year</a> will be due to model inference needs, with “Nvidia deriving about 40% of its data center revenue just from inference.”</em> </p>
<p><strong>― NVIDIA’s chips are the tastiest AI can find. It’s stock still has ways to go</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amritaroy.substack.com/p/nvidias-chips-are-the-tastiest-ai">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good summary of Nvidia’s strategies towards computing, path to AI domination, tailwinds of efficiency, position in the future.</p>
<p>Nvidia is “at the right place at the right time”: </p>
<ul>
<li>During 2000-2010 where the world successfully emerged from the dot-com bust, demand of Nvidia’s GPUs increased as the proliferation of games and multimedia applications. By 2011, Nvidia had already begun to reposition the company’s strategy for GPU chips towards mobile computing. At the same time, the concept of cloud computing, crypto-mining, and data center started to form.</li>
<li>Nvidia has built grounded relationship with academics and researchers. According to the paper published by Andrew Ng to show the power of NVIDIA GPU. During 2011-2015, Ng had been working as the Chief Scientist at many big tech firms and deployed data center architectures based on Nvidia’s GPUs. During 2010-2014, data center and HPC grew at a compounded growth rate of 64%. This period of time was one of the moments that set Nvidia on the course to dominate AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>In semiconductor industry, there are two different ways of manufacturing chips at scale:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designing and manufacturing your own chip - what Intel was doing. Manufacturing chips can be very expensive and hard. Today, chip foundries such as Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung are able to maintain leading edge.</li>
<li>Designing and producing powerful chips at a quicker pace by partnering with chip foundries like TSMC - what Nvidia and AMD fabless companies are doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024 could be the first year that Huang’s Nvidia could cede some market share to AMD. AMD launched their own MI300-series and Intel launched their Gaudi3 AI Accelerator chip, aiming to get back share from Nvidia’s H100&#x2F;H200 chips. However Huang looks ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Huang believes Nvidia must turn its attention to the next leg of AI - Model Inference. </p>
<p>Tech companies spend more on AI data center equipment over years, Nvidia’s revenue won’t slow down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nvidia’s executives also believe that company can benefit from demand from specific industry verticals, such as automotive.s</p>
<p>Tesla, for example, is leading self driving cars.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automotive AI and Sovereign AI are two future areas of growth where enterprises continue to spend on data centers for model training and inferencing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors also assessed Nvidia’s valuation and believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 2023 and 2026, Nvidia’s sales should be growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 43–45%.</li>
<li>Over the next 3 years, they expect operating profit to grow in line with revenue growth, with operating profit margins remaining relatively flat in 2025 and 2026.</li>
</ul>

<li><em>Engineering the silicon for your unique workloads for higher performance through architectural innovation.</em></li>
<li><em>Strategic control and lock-in over certain workloads.</em></li>
<li><em>Cost savings from removing margin stacking of fabless design firms.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>The removal of these workloads from server CPU cores to the custom Nitro chip not only greatly improves cost, but also improves performance due to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/is-ampere-computings-cloud-native">removing noisy neighbor problems</a> associated with the hypervisor, such as shared caches, IO bandwidth, and power&#x2F;heat budgets.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>A good overview of Amazon’s in-house semiconductor designs (Nitro, Graviton, SSDs, Inferentia, and Trainium). It includes how Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Nvidia Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, Equinix Fabric, Coreweave, Cloudflare, and Lambda are each fighting Amazon’s dominance across multiple vectors and to various degrees.</p>
<p>Amazon’s custom silicon efforts - Nitro:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS worked with Cavium on developing the custom SoC on a discrete PCIe card and associated software, named “Nitro System”. It removes workloads from server CPU cores to the custom Nitro chips.</li>
<li>Annapurna Labs was acquired by Amazon in 2015. It focuses on server SOCs for networking and storage. Amazon was trying to continue its efforts on storage, and Nitro is the main enabler of a competitive advantage in these storage and databases.</li>
<li>Nitro provides services such as virtual disk to the tenant’s virtual machines and enables customers to dynamically grow and shrink high performance storage at low cost. </li>
<li>Amazon worked with Marvell to co-design the AWS Nitro SSD controller. The focus was on avoiding latency spikes and latency variability, and maximizing the lifetime of the SSD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other two clouds (Google and Microsoft) are years behind Amazon, both required a partner, and both were stuck with 1st or 2nd generation merchant silicon for the next few years. </p>
<p>James Hamilton, an engineer in Amazon, had and look at two key ways in which using AWS-designed, Arm-based CPUs could offer advantages compared to their external counterparts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using Arm’s scale in mobile by using the arm-designed Neoverse cores or </li>
<li>TSMC’s manufacturing scale. Both would reduce costs and offer better value to customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>In-house CPUs enables Amazon to design CPUs to maximize density and minimize server and system level energy which helps reduce costs. The tremendous scale of Amazon especially regarding general-purpose compute and storage-related verticals will continue to drive a durable advantage in the cloud for many years.</p>

<p><em>Ultrafusion is Apple’s marketing name for using a local silicon interconnect (bridge die) to connect the two M2 Max chips in a package. The two chips are exposed as a single chip to many layers of software. M2 Ultra utilizes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/advanced-packaging-part-1-pad-limited">TSMC’s InFO-LSI packaging technology</a>. This is a similar concept as TSMC’s CoWoS-L that is being adopted by Nvidia’s Blackwell and future accelerators down the road to make large chips. The only major difference between Apple and Nvidia’s approaches are that InFO is chip-first vs CoWoS-L is chip-last process flow, and that they are using different types of memory.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Apple’s purchases of GPUs are minuscule and Apple is not a top 10 customer of Nvidia. The production of M2 Ultras can be consistent with the fact that Apple is using their own silicon in their own data centers for serving AI to Apple users. And Apple has expansion plans for their own data center infrastructure. Furthermore, Apple made a number of hires including Sumit Gupta who joined to lead cloud infrastructure at Apple in March. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Starbucks had offered a gift card since 2001 and started to pair it with a new loyalty program “Starbucks Rewards” in 2008. Consumers are allowed to access free wifi and refillable coffee by paying with a reloadable card. The card was put onto an app in 2010 and expanded to over 9000 locations. It quickly became the largest combined mobile payments in loyalty program in the US. Uses load or reload around $10 B of value onto their cards each year and so about $1.9B of stored card value sat on the company’s balance sheet, just like customer deposits. There are several advantages: 1) the company does not pay interest on customer funds, and 2) sweep customer funds into company’s own bank account when it concludes customers may have forgotten about them - this is called ‘breakage’. In late 2023, Starbucks was accused of making it impossible for consumers to spend down their stored value cards by only allowing funds to be added in $5 increments and requiring a $10 minimum spend. Although the company has to pay rewards to customers, it saves on merchant discount fees and receives a lots of free and valuable personal information about customers.</p>
<p>Delta’s SkyMiles scheme is one of the largest globally with 25 M active members.

<p>The main point is that, as generative AI is ingested into the web, a decades-old system of online referrals and business building will be reshaped. The business model of every existing business (online travel, ecommerce, online advertising, etc) on the internet are impacted due to the transformation of online search by AI. It decreases the number of customer’s impressions on the internet thus reduce advertiser’s chance of being charged. And it also reduces the chance for startups to be observed and build brands. </p>

<p>According to Anshu Sharma, the future of AI startups (OpenAI and Anthropic) could be dim, and big tech companies (Microsoft and Google) will make profits from existing users and networks but need to spend a lot of money for a long time, which would leave the AI startups unable to compete. This is true that AI startups are already struggling right now, because at current stage AI is hard to commoditized, and it requires a lot of investments.</p>
<p>The improvement of AI is slowing down because they exhausted all available data on the internet. Regarding the adoption of AI in enterprise, time is required to make sure that chatbots can replace the specialized knowledge of human experts due to technical challenges.</p>

<p><em>For many years, particularly following the original SARS pandemic, there was a lot of conversations around how do we get in front of the next pandemic, how do we figure out what’s coming and how do we prepare for it. And there was a lot of research that was launched to try and resolve that key question. It’s like does the effort to try and stop the problem cause the problem. I think that from my point of view there is a very high probability that there was some leak that meant that the work that was going on to try and get in front of the next pandemic and understand what we could do to prepare ourselves, and what vaccines could be developed and so on, actually led to the pandemic. So then when that happens how do you respond when you are sitting in that seat, that’s the key question that I think this committee is uncovering. - David Friedberg</em></p>

<p>In the interview, Toner revealed that the reason of firing Altman is his psychological abuse and being manipulative in different situation. Looking at Altman’s track record prior to OpenAI, it seems those are not new problems of Sam.</p>

<p>Amazon’s drone delivery services “Prime Air” was laid out more than a decade ago but has struggled since then. In 2022, Amazon said it would begin testing deliveries in College Station, Texas. In 2023, Prime Air was hit by layoffs. But recently Amazon said it would expand drone operations to Phoenix, Arizona, etc. And it’s expected to expand to other cities in 2025.</p>
