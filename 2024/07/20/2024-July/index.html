<p><strong>Playing defense: How to control the narrative if your work is being questioned - Wes Kao’s Newsletter</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/playing-defense-how-to-control-narrative">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s normal that people will misunderstand and disagree with you. what we need to do is to 1) learn to explain your ideas better and 2) stay calm and share your thought process in the most objective way possible.</p>
<p>Defending your thinking means to share logic, evidence and rationale that explains why you believe your conclusion is the right one. It’s not to try to protect your ego by refusing to acknowledge a good argument, and being delusional about the strength of your claim. Being able to play defense is important because it’s about your credibility. If you do it well you are building more trust, otherwise you will be diminishing trust.</p>
<p>Some suggestions mentioned in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>﻿﻿Have a rationale of every small decision you made.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Try to anticipate questions.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Embrace “show, not tell”</li>
<li>﻿﻿React as positively as possible. e.g.<br> “Ah! I’m so glad you asked”.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Consider the question behind the question.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Be happy that the person voiced their concern.</li>
<li>﻿﻿Beware of insecure vibes.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you overcompensate, you’ll come across as defensive. This decreases your credibility too. You’ll need to use your judgment and read the situation. An open, curious, and almost playful attitude shows you’re not afraid of hard questions.</p>
<p>Many people underestimate the daily moments where your credibility can either be reinforced or eroded. This might sound dramatic, but it’s quite banal: Every interaction folks have with you gets added to their subconscious cumulative repository of data points about you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Insecure vibes are subconscious clues and signals that you might be giving off when you’re feeling anxious, nervous, or uncertain. Get rid of insecure vibes—and your writing, meetings, presentations, negotiations, and pitches will become stronger.</em></p>
<p><strong>― “Insecure vibes” are a self-fulfilling prophecy - Wes Kao’s Newsletter</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/insecure-vibes-are-a-self-fulfilling">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following situations, insecure vibes happen: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>When other person touched on your sore spot and you feel threatened</p>
</li>
<li><p>You assume the person will say no before you even start</p>
<p>This can make you talk fast - showing you enter the conversation already playing defense. You don’t give the person a chance to say yes because you’ve already said no to yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You insist on email or slack when you know a phone call is better</p>
<p>Explaining your point in writing is a sign of lacking confidence and avoiding confrontation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You over-explain because you expect the other person to be skeptical</p>
<p>You bring up counterpoints to arguments no one has mentioned. Not a good time to do so. It looks like you intentionally bring up something new to surprise others rather than having a reasonable justification of your point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid being doubtful if you actually feel confident:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t preface your idea with too many caveats. Speak in complete sentences. Remove “ands” and “buts” that create never-ending sentences, which can sound less authoritative. </li>
<li>Notice if you start to ramble. Try to prepare the first few lines of what you want to say to kick off a meeting, so you start strong. </li>
<li>Practice your actual script so you get comfortable saying those words.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get rid of insecure vibes, ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>Could this be interpreted as sounding defensive?</li>
<li>Am I overcompensating or overexplaining?</li>
<li>How would I respond on my best day?</li>
<li>Would I say this if I felt secure?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strategy, not self-expression: How to decide what to say when giving feedback - Wes Kao’s Newsletter</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/strategy-not-self-expression">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself “Is this strategy or self expression?” before giving feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not self-express your feeling or complain. Do not say anything that does not motivate them to change. Instead, say things that get you closer to changing the person’s behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to focus on strategy rather than self-expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mentally forgive this person</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identify what is most likely to motivate them to change, </p>
</li>
<li><p>Say only 10% that will actually change behavior, thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this make them even more effective?</li>
<li>How will this allow them to work even better with the people around them?</li>
<li>How does this get them closer to their goals?</li>
<li>How is this a skill they can apply now and in all future roles?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t trigger the defensiveness in the first place</p>
<p>The minute your recipient gets defensive, it becomes a lot harder to undo the defensiveness and get them to accept what you’re saying. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Let the other person talk, e.g.  “I’d love to hear what you think. What parts are resonating most with you?”</p>
<p>The other benefit of letting the other person talk is <em>cognitive dissonance</em>: if they say out loud what they are committed to doing differently, they are reinforcing the idea in their own mind. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep your eyes on the person’s behavior change</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always be framing</p>
<p>“Strategy, not self-expression” applies to many more situations too.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Every week, we make business cases at work. I’m defining a business case as any recommendation to pursue a business opportunity or solve a problem. A business case can be a 5-page document, 5 sentences in Slack, or a 5-minute phone call. The larger the project, the more you may need to make a comprehensive business case. But the underlying premise is the same: If you don’t explain why a problem matters, your colleagues won’t have the necessary information to decide how to support you.</em></p>

<p><strong>Paramount Merges With Skydance - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/paramount-merges-with-skydance">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PARA agreed to merge with Skydance. The new CEO is Skydance Media CEO David Ellison whose father Larry Ellison is the founder of Oracle. </p>
<p>Old paramount businesses: 1) filmed entertainment (Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon movie), 2) TV media (Paramount’s broadcast) and cable television networks, like CBS and MTV, 3) Direct to consumer streaming services like Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Its current problems: 1) flat revenue, 2) streaming services are losing, 3) high long-term debt but low cash.</p>
<p>New Paramount Plan: 1) unify marquee rights, 2) reorganize finance, 3) transition into a tech-media hybrid.</p>
<p>For the #3, the vision is to better position Paramount on the front end (DTC apps) and the back end (cloud infrastructure, cloud-based production, and AI tools). Specifically, they are going to 1) rebuild DTC into a differentiated platform, 2) build studio-in-the-cloud, 3) leverage Gen AI.</p>

<p><strong>Fintech Shake-Up - App Economy Insights</strong> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.appeconomyinsights.com/p/fintech-shake-up">Link</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple Pay unveiled a new peer-to-peer (P2P) feature called “Tap to Cash”, which is a natural evolution of the existing “Tap to Pay”.   This is not the only case where big tech offers features that directly compete with financial institutions: Google Wallet, Amazon’s lending program for sellers, etc, competing with PayPal’s Venmo, Block’s Cash App, etc. Big tech’s move not only intensifies competition within P2P payment, but also raises questions about the future of the payment industry.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visa and Mastercard both face mobile wallet threats to card-based business model.</li>
<li>American Express renowned for its premium card offerings, targeting high spending high credit quality customers, continuing to attract millennials and Gen Z customers. The recent strategic acquisitions are Tock (a reservation platform for high end restaurant and events) and Rooam (a mobile payment and ordering platform for restaurants and venues). However, it’s sensitive to economic downturns and facing competitions for other premium card issuers and digital payment platforms. </li>
<li>Fiserv’s merchant solutions and financial solutions look positive, it’s actively investing in digital transformation, and it recently acquired BentoBox (a digital marketing and commerce platform for restaurants).</li>
<li>Adyen serves large enterprise clients with its unified commerce platform</li>
<li>PayPal lowered its FY 2024 guidance. It’s facing a decline in active accounts. To solve this, it focuses on strategic partnerships such as collaboration with Apple. It’s facing competitive pressure from Big Tech payment solutions like Apple Pay and Google Pay. It’s currently undergoing significant restructuring such as layoffs and leadership change. And it’s initiating AI-powered personalized ads platform and strengthening relationships with SME customers.</li>
<li>Block’s growth is driven by its momentum of Cash App ecosystem, square ecosystem, and significant investment in Bitcoin. However, it’s facing challenges of regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency activities and compliance practices, competition from established competitors and fintech startups, needs of balancing growth and profitability given FY 2024 guidance.</li>
</ol>
<p>What to watch for the shift in payment landscape:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facing legal battle from Big Tech, can Visa and Mastercard find innovation or new solutions to maintain their revenue streams from swipe fee?</li>
<li>Will Digital Wallet dominant payment industry? Will traditional cards remain or be replace?</li>
<li>New possibilities of payments have been developed such as Buy Now and Pay Later (BNPL). Will innovations gain mainstream adoption in payment industry?</li>
<li>Can the challenges of cryptocurrencies be overcome? Will cryptocurrencies be mainstream adoption?</li>
<li>As consumers are demanding seamless, secure, cheaper, and personalized payment experiences, companies that can provide such services will become successful in the future.</li>

<p>Broadcom now operates across two primary segments: 1) semiconductor solutions (chips for networking, server storage, broadband, wireless communication, and industrial applications), and 2) infrastructure software (a explosive leap with the acquisition of VMware). </p>
<p>Highlights: VMware acquisition brings significant revenue to Broadcom; AI as a great growth driver; jumbo acquisition resulted in gigantic net debt; strong cash generation; 10-for-1 stock split on July 15. </p>
<p>Future: Next-generation products include Tomahawk and Jericho; supply chain disruption and inflation resulted from macroeconomic environment; regulatory scrutiny into VMware acquisition.</p>

<p>Three main issues: </p>
<ol>
<li>the boycott impact: losing 1.5M loyal customers, as a result of the fact that in October 2023, Starbucks became embroiled in a controversy related to the ongoing violence in the Middle East, </li>
<li>significant loss in traffic from non-Rewards members due to additional reasons such as awareness of daily drink price, gourmet coffee boom, health-conscious consumers, changing work habits, and competitors with coffee offerings in lower prices. Solutions on this are new initiatives such as physical and digital enhancements like updated POS system, siren system speedup, and opening mobile orders beyond its loyalty programs.</li>
<li>Price war in Chinese coffee market e.g. Luckin Coffee.</li>

<p><em>You cannot spend this kind of money and show no incremental revenue potential. So while this is incredible for NVIDIA, the chicken is coming home to roast, because if you do not start seeing revenue flow to the bottom line of these companies that are spending 26 B dollars a quarter, the market cap of NVIDIA is not what the market cap of NVIDIA should be, and all of these other companies are going toe get punished for spending this kind of money. Where are all these new fangled things that we are supposed to see that justifies a hundred billion dollar of chip spend a year, two hundreds billion dollars of energy spend, a hundred billion dollars of all this other stuff, we are now spending 750 billion dollars. This is on the order of a national transfer payment, and we’ve seen nothing to show for it except that you can mimic somebody’s voice. It doesn’t all hang together yet. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>There’s gaps in the quality of the products that can be created to not have hallucination. Those gaps are too large right now for them to be used reliably in production settings unless you have a very defined scope. If you have a defined scope though, the implementation costs are not nearly what needs the level of spend to support. So there is just a big mismatch. Second is that we have a huge problem with NVIDIA, which is you can’t spend this kind of money to have tech lock-in to one hardware vendor, and that makes no sense. And what you are seeing now is that Amazon Google Microsoft AMD Intel, a plethora of startups Grok, everybody trying to make now different hardware solution. The problem though is that we have this massive lock-in right now, because the code is littered with all these NVIDIA specific ways of implementing access to GPUs, that’s not sustainable. So we are in an existential thrash and I think the only way that we are going to get around this is to do a little bit of a reset. And I think that’s going to touch a lot of startups that have already taken down way too much money at really insane valuations. I think we are in a bit of a reckoning right now it’s going to be complicated couple of quarters to at a minimum and probably a complicated year to sort out who’s actually real. - Chamath Palihapitiya</em></p>
<p><em>There is ton of capital that was raised during the covid bubble era, and the ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) era, that needed a place to go. And a lot of traditional business model, traditional in the technology sense - SAS and a lot of biotech stuff, it became uninvestable. Then there is a lot of money in the public markets that was sitting on the sidelines, that was sitting in treasuries and so on. So every dollar is looking for growth and there is a lot of dollars still sitting around out there from the ZIRP era and the coming into this kind of post ZIRP era, looking for a place to growth. And there is very little growth as we talked about with the S&amp;P 479 not being very performative with respect to growth and revenue and having great outlook for the next five years. So then when there is a glimmer of upside there is a glimmer of opportunity, even if it’s just painting a picture of a growth story, all the capital drives into it. And we’ve all heard stories about these series a startups in AI, getting bit up to a 100M valuation. I’ve seen a couple of these where people have pitch me things on like protein modeling AI startups, and it’s literally like two guys from meta and openai that left and started this company, and they raised 30 on a 12 per year or something, and it’s just two guys building a model. That’s because that capital needs to find a place where it can tell itself a growth story. So I think we are still dealing with the capital hangover from ZIRP. And the fact there is an area to invest for real growth that has allowed the AI bubble to grow as quickly as it has. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>Now as Chamath points out we are kind of rationalizing that back and I do think that there is going to be a reset. Now I’ll also say that the Goldman report which I read and some of the other analyses that have been done. I think there was some commentary or some analysis that hey it costs me six times as much as having an analyst do this work. The energy cost of the AI is still so high, the actual performance of the model is not good. What that fails to write it’s right and wrong. It’s right in the sense that yes it’ s more expensive today and ROI is not there today. It’s wrong in that it ignores the performative model improvements that we’re seeing in nearly any metric over the past couple of months. Every few months as we know we see new models, new improvements, new architectures, new ways to leveraging the chips to actually drive a lover token cost, to drive lower energy cost per answer, lower energy cost per run. Every metric that matters is improving, so if you fast forward another 24 or 36 months, I do think that there is a great reason to be optimistic that there is going to be extraordinary ROI based on the infrastructure that’s being built. It’s a question of are you going to get payback before the next cycle of infrastructure needs to be made and everything comes back in. We saw this during the dotcom boom where a lot of people built out data centers and by the time they were able to actually able to make money on those data centers, it was like hey all the new Telco equipment, all the new servers needs to be put in, and everything got written off. So there is a big capex kind of question mark here, but I do think that the fundamental economics of AI will be proven over the next couple of quarters. - David Friedberg</em></p>
<p><em>I’m much more bullish than you guys about this investment that’s being made. Remember that when the internet got started in the 90s, it was via dialup. I mean you literally had to have a modem and you would dial up the internet and it was incredibly slow. Photo sharing didn’t even work, so social networking wasn’t possible. And basically what happened next was that the Telecom company spent a ton of money building out broadband and people started upgrading to broadband. Then we had the Doom crash everyone thought that telecom companies had wasted billions of dollars investing in all this Broadband infrastructure. And it turned out that no they were right to do that, it just took a while for that to get used and this is a pretty common pattern with technological revolutions is that you can have a bubble in the short term but then it gets justified in the mid to long term. The build out of the railroads in the United States another example of this we had huge railroad bubbles but it turned out that that investment was all worthwhile. - David Sacks</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>This team generated 1B personas based on web info and stored them into a Persona Hub. They introduced a synthetic data generation method called ‘persona-driven data synthesis’. These personas can be potentially used to 1) generate personalized content, 2) support LLM prompting, 3) enhance product research, 4) create NPCs in games. The compression perspective is more interesting and helpful for understanding the approach: Persona Hub can be seen as the compressed form of the world knowledge into distributed carriers. And the public web text can be seen as the decompressed content created by these personas with their knowledge and experiences.</p>
